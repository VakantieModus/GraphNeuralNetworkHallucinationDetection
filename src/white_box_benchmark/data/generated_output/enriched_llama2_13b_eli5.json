    "Answer": "It's a quirk of the human eye. At the center of the eye (the fovea) we mostly have colour-sensitive cone cells to see detail and colour of what we're focusing on. Around the fovea we mostly have rod cells that can't see colour but are more sensitive to variations in light intensity and movement.  Looking slightly to the side of the thing you're examining sends more of the light to the rod cells and lets you see things more clearly in low-light conditions where cones don't work well.",

It is easier to operate, which may free up your attention for focus on what is *outside* the car. Some people derive satisfaction from shifting, and flexibility in using the power curve.",

    "Answer": "I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough (as I very rarely post here), but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth. What happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time. Other factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to \"feed\" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that's an ELI5 for another day.",

    "Answer": "Two things going on here. First, heat doesn't have anything to do with sunburn, it's all about UV rays. Encountering more UV rays = more sunburn. However, dark skin absorbs more UV rays than pale skin. And in fact that's exactly why it burns less. The pigmented layer absorbs more UV in the upper layers of the skin, shading the cells underneath from UV and preventing burns (because it's the lower, reproducing cells that matter, the upper ones are disposable protection). Just like sitting outside under an opaque black umbrella would shade you more than sitting outside under a translucent white one.",

    "output": "1. Chickenpox is caused by the Varicella-Zoster virus (VZV).\n2. The VZV is a DNA virus that infects the skin and the nervous system.\n3. The virus is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets and direct contact with the skin lesions.\n4. Chickenpox is more severe in adults because the immune system is less able to recognize and respond to the virus.\n5. Adults may also have underlying medical conditions that make them more susceptible to severe infection.\n6. The symptoms of chickenpox in adults can include fever, headache, fatigue, and muscle aches.\n7. The skin lesions are usually more severe and widespread in adults, and may cause scarring.\n8. In severe cases, adults may develop complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, or Reye's syndrome.\n9. Treatment for chickenpox in adults includes antiviral medications and supportive care such as pain relief and fluids.\n10. Prevention of chickenpox in adults includes vaccination and avoiding contact with infected individuals.\n11. Vaccination against chickenpox is recommended for all children and adults who have not been previously infected.\n12. The vaccine is effective in preventing the disease and reducing the severity of symptoms in those who do become infected.\n13. The vaccine is safe and has been shown to be effective in reducing the risk of complications.\n14. The vaccine is recommended for adults who have not been previously infected, regardless of their age.\n15. The vaccine is also recommended for adults who have a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV or cancer.\n16. The vaccine is recommended for adults who are in close contact with children or adults who are at risk of complications from chickenpox.\n17.

    "Answer": "It's mostly due to the difference in immune system between a child and an adult. A primary varicella zoster infection (chickenpox) in adulthood is indeed associated with increased risk of complications. Most of these complications are due to the intense response by the adult immune system that comes into contact with the virus for the first time. Children have less active immune systems, but usually active enough to clear the virus - making them immune to it thereafter, and are therefore less likely to develop complications with this particular infection. The same goes to hepatitis A: adults develop jaundice, while children are asymptomatic.  Note: a secondary varicella zoster infection during adulthood is called \"shingles\" and is generally less dangerous than a primary varicella during adulthood, due to the immunity that is already present at the time of the second infection.",

    "Answer": "The theater will be fined a massive amount of money for allowing a leak, the person leaking it will be fined a massive amount of money for uploading it, and they automatically lose their job. This is a combination of copyright law violation and contracts that you sign when taking the job. So the risk are so extremely high that most will not risk it.  They also have security features such as login codes to open, proprietary file types that need special programs to play, and the rooms operating the projector system requiring special key access at times.",

    "Answer": "Yes, they could 'throw' a case. However, that's a serious ethics violation which would almost certainly cause disbarment if found out, and not only that, the conviction could then be appealed based on ineffective assistance of counsel (embodied in the 6th amendment). If it makes it easier to wrap your head around, think of defense lawyers defending the integrity of the judicial system, not just their client. The idea being, the system must obey all of its own rules in proving that someone is guilty, or else it's a dishonest system and could easily \"prove\" that an innocent person is guilty next time. Defense lawyers are there to help ensure the system stays honest.",

    "Answer": "You absolutely could.  But the fact is that evolution shaped our tastes. That's why fatty foods and sweet foods are so appealing to out taste buds. It is our bodies way of saying \"That has lots of calories and will help us avoid starving.\" The 'satisfaction' you feel on swallowing it is simply the body saying \"Good job. Remember that tastes good so we will eat it again if we find it again.\" Rewarding you for fueling it.  You can see why this system that evolved when we were hunter gatherers to keep us from starving and helping us learn whats best to eat leads to obesity now that we have food options everywhere anytime we want.  Fun fact: Most people mistake the bodies thirst craving for being hungry. More often than not if you drink a glass of water when you feel the urge to snack it will go away. Thus helping you lose weight by reducing total calorie intake.",

    "Answer": "Let's think about this from an evolutionary perspective. Way back in the day, (like way way way back) humans struggled for food just like every other animal. It was to our species evolutionary advantage to pursue food that would keep us full longer, or provide more energy than other food options. Fats, are 9 calories per gram compared to proteins and carbs that are 4 calories. Humans that preferred fats and craved them, had a higher chance of survival and passing on the fat craving trait. Fast forward to present day where food is plentiful. We are still programmed to eat high calorie foods just in case we won't find food for a week!",

    "Answer": "While not universally true (especially in the case of Europe who gets to be called its own continent for purely cultural/political reasons) A continent is considered to be the primary landmass on its tectonic plate. If you look at a map of tectonic plates: _URL_0_ You can clearly see that with a few notable exceptions such as Europe and India. In general continents occupy their own tectonic plate.  So then if you are a landmass that is part of a continent's tectonic plate but is not connected by land to that continent, than you would be an island. Although even this is a fairly tenuous definition.",

The water purifier jugs are effective against bacteria and some viruses but not against all the viruses.\nAnswer: A water purifier jug works by filtering the water through a filter. The filter is made of activated carbon, which removes impurities from the water. The activated carbon also removes chlorine and other chemicals from the water, making it safe to drink.\nAnswer: 3rd world ditch water is not safe for drinking because it is contaminated with bacteria, viruses, and other harmful substances. These contaminants can cause serious illnesses, such as cholera and typhoid fever.\nExplain why the water purifier jugs are not effective against all viruses.

    "Answer": "The passive type of jug won't filter out bacteria and other things that can make you sick. There is a thing called [LifeStraw](_URL_0_) that can do this, but it forces water through a filter as you use it. Something like a reverse osmosis system can make water safe, but that also involves forcing water through a membrane. These things can't be done with just gravity.",

    "output": "100% accurate\nIn the US, sales tax is not included in the list price. This is because sales tax is a separate tax imposed by the state or local government on the sale of goods or services. The list price is the price of the product or service before any taxes are applied.\nIncluding sales tax in the list price would make the price more confusing for consumers, as they would have to factor in the sales tax when comparing prices between different products or services. It would also make it harder for businesses to calculate their costs and profits, as they would have to account for the sales tax when calculating their costs and margins.\nAdditionally, sales tax rates can vary depending on the state or local government, and including sales tax in the list price would make it harder for businesses to comply with tax laws and regulations.\nIn summary, sales tax is not included in the list price in the US because it is a separate tax imposed by the state or local government and it would make it harder for businesses to calculate their costs and profits, as well as for consumers to compare prices between different products or services.",

    "Answer": "The Voltage of a battery depends on the charge. A five voltage battery may start with 5.1 Volt and slowly go down. When you're at 4.9 volt you'll know the battery is rather empty. I'm not sure if that is the case for all modern Rechargeable batteries. They might have special measuring and charging chips included.",

    "Answer": "Our brains like familiar things. Something we already have seen is easier to get into than something brand new because it requires less attention and effort from our brain.

    "Answer": "Phones lack a cooling system because there's no room for that. It takes up way too much space for a pocket-size device. If that wasn't an issue, phones would've had vents. Besides, phones don't work as hard as other computers do. They are weaker, so they produce less heat. Still, they can get hot sometimes, especially during charging, and there is nothing we can do about it. Phones cool by radiating heat away and through conduction - passing heat into the surrounding air/skin.",

    "output": "1. The microwave oven is a device that uses microwave radiation to heat food and other objects.\n2. The radiation is emitted from a magnetron, which is a type of electron tube that produces microwaves.\n3. The microwaves are then reflected off the walls of the oven cavity and back into the food.\n4. The microwaves cause the water molecules in the food to vibrate and heat up.\n5. The heat is then transferred to the food, causing it to cook.\n6. The inside of the microwave is made of metal because it is a good conductor of heat.\n7. Metallic objects can reflect the microwaves and cause them to bounce around inside the oven, which can lead to uneven cooking.\n8. It is also possible for the microwaves to cause sparks to fly if there is enough metal in the oven.\n9. This can lead to a fire.\n10. For these reasons, it is important to only put food and other non-metallic objects in the microwave.\n11. If you do need to put a metallic object in the microwave, be sure to cover it with a microwave-safe plate or container.\n12. This will help to prevent the microwaves from reflecting off the metal and causing sparks to fly.\n13. It is also important to only use microwave-safe plates and containers in the microwave, as some materials can be damaged by the microwaves.\n14. Finally, be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions for your microwave oven.\n15. These instructions will tell you what types of materials are safe to use in the microwave.\n16. By following these guidelines, you can help to ensure that your microwave oven is safe and effective.\n17. If you have any questions about using your microwave oven, be sure to consult the manufacturer's instructions.\n18. You can also contact a qualified appliance repair technician for more information.\n19. Remember, it is important to only put food and other non-metallic objects in the microwave.\n20.

    "Answer": "The metal interior of the oven is grounded. It does pick up a charge from the microwaves, but the charge is dissipated to ground, and so does not arc. Your fork, or the foil on your plate, are not grounded, and thus the charge can build up until it is strong enough to arc to a grounded panel.",

    "Answer": "The simple answer is stress causes this. By setting a schedule your body will fall into a rhythm. After a while you don't really need the alarm at all. However as we know our natural rythems get disturbed occasionally. When we must get up we are creating stress that is easiest to avoid by doing nothing and that is what we want to do (avoid stress). On the weekend you don't have stress to avoid and your body is doing its thing. A sign of depression (just one of the signs) is oversleeping. Your mind allowing your body to avoid the stress of life every chance you get. Feel good that you feel awake when you don't have to. Your life is manageable to you.",

    "output": "1. The main reason for the violent reaction is the high electromagnetic radiation emitted from the microwave oven. When the microwave oven is turned on, the electric current passes through the waveguide and the high-frequency electromagnetic field is generated. The high-frequency electromagnetic field causes the electrons in the metal to oscillate rapidly, causing the metal to heat up rapidly. The metal then reacts violently when it is heated up to a certain temperature.\n2. In addition, the metal also reacts violently when it is heated up to a certain temperature due to the chemical reaction that occurs between the metal and the oxygen in the air. The metal reacts with the oxygen in the air to form a compound called metal oxide. The metal oxide is a solid and it is formed when the metal reacts with the oxygen in the air. The metal oxide is a solid and it is formed when the metal reacts with the oxygen in the air. The metal oxide is a solid and it is formed when the metal reacts with the oxygen in the air.\n3.

    "Answer": "The way microwaves work is through jiggling charged/polar particles in your food (the water primarily). This jiggling increases their temperature and that heats up the rest of your food. That's why you can't heat oil as easily as you can water. However, metals like iron are *great* conductors of electrons. What makes them good conductors is a little complicated but basically, the reason is that they have a soup of electrons moving from atom to atom with almost 0 energy needed to move an electron from one atom to another.  Thus when the microwave jiggles these electrons, rather than giving energy to the atom, it gives it to the electron which zips around in the soup. The amount of energy given to the soup can get high enough to bypass the natural insulation of the air and cause electrons to jump from the metal and rip through the air. This is called a spark and is basically what happens during a lightning strike.",

    "Answer": "It's not so much that Americans developed a distinct accent, but rather that speech on both sides of the Atlantic changed significantly, with both sides diverging quite a bit from what they had sounded like earlier on. This process is still happening, with accents on the Canadian and US sides of the great lakes undergoing vowel shifts at this very moment, and in opposite directions; Canadian and US accents are actually becoming less similar, even among people in the niagara region who live a few km apart. Why? We don't really understand this process at all well. The key thing relevant to your question though is that accents change a lot, that distance and separation make this process easier and more likely, and that neither English nor an American speakers sound much like their 16th century forebears.",

    "prompt": "Question: Why do The Miranda Rights state that anything you say can \"and will\" be used against you. If something's not incriminating why would it be used against you? Why would cops be forced to admit this up front?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. Miranda rights are a set of rights a person has when they are being interrogated by the police. They are called Miranda rights because the Supreme Court case that established them was Miranda v. Arizona (1966). The Miranda rights are: the right to remain silent, the right to an attorney, and the right to have an attorney present during questioning.\nThe right to remain silent is the most important Miranda right. It means that the police cannot force a person to talk to them. The police can only ask questions, they cannot make a person answer them. If a person does not want to talk to the police, they do not have to. The police cannot use this as evidence against the person in court.\nThe right to an attorney is the second most important Miranda right. It means that the police cannot interrogate a person without an attorney present. The police can only ask questions, they cannot make a person answer them. If a person does not want to talk to the police, they do not have to. The police cannot use this as evidence against the person in court.\nThe right to have an attorney present during questioning is the third most important Miranda right. It means that the police cannot interrogate a person without an attorney present. The police can only ask questions, they cannot make a person answer them. If a person does not want to talk to the police, they do not have to. The police cannot use this as evidence against the person in court.\nThe Miranda rights are very important because they protect a person's right to remain silent and to have an attorney present during questioning.

    "Answer": "Since rewinding needs to be done for each playback, what makes you think it is the rewinding which causes quality loss? Tapes lose quality over time whether you play them or not due to breakdown of the binder and dry lubricant. Rewinding is no more damaging than playback if the VCR is functioning correctly.  There is a phenomenon called [print-through](_URL_0_) which transfers signal from one layer to the next. Professional audio engineers often store reel to reel tapes \"tails out\". That means without rewinding. It doesn't stop print-through, but it does make it happen later rather than earlier, so on playback it will be heard after a track rather than before.

    "Answer": "Librarian here. A lot of that stuff comes from stores and reserves from other libraries in the system. My library authority has been around since 1890 and has accumulated decades of stuff that due to archiving policies /librarian OCD hoarding we never throw out, For example we have 23 libraries in our group with over 750,000 items. Around a 1/6 of that stock is reserves and then rotated to other libraries so it appears new to the customers of that branch. Encyclopaedias are really common actually, especially older ones we have around 10 full sets of the most common things like Britannica and Oxford. Any book dealer will most likely have a few sets kicking around if you are short. In the UK the British Library has virtually every book and periodical ever published, I assume the Library of Congress is the same in US and we can get copies of stuff from them.  TL:DR a combination of stuff hidden in basements and storage supplemented by specialist periodical providers",

    "Answer": "It's a matter of emphasis. \"We aren't going\" could be simply spoken, or the \"we\" could be emphasized (an emphasis that is lost in simple text). Similarly \"We're not going\" could be used to emphasize the \"not\" part. Beyond that it's preference. The stylistic choices of language are everywhere, and it's one of the main reasons that most sentences of reasonable length have never been written before.",

    "output": "1. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a 13-day confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union in October 1962. The crisis is considered the closest the two superpowers have ever come to nuclear war. The crisis started when the United States discovered Soviet nuclear missiles in Cuba, which the Soviets had installed to deter an American invasion of Cuba. The U.S. responded by threatening to invade Cuba, and the Soviet Union responded by threatening to use nuclear weapons. The crisis was resolved when the Soviets agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for the United States removing its missiles from Turkey.\n2. The United States has a long history of interfering in Cuban affairs. The United States has tried to overthrow the Cuban government on multiple occasions, most notably in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. The United States also imposed a trade embargo on Cuba in 1962, which is still in place today. The embargo has been a major source of tension between the two countries.\n3. The Cuban Missile Crisis was a major event in the Cold War. The crisis highlighted the risks of nuclear war and the need for diplomacy. The crisis also led to the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n4.

    "Answer": "The beef wasn't with Cuba, the beef was with the USSR. The Soviets were trying to use their communist ally in The West as a beachhead for terror. (Not the modern definition of terror, the old-fashioned one). By placing ICBMs in Cuba (aimed at the United States) they wanted to cast a cloak of fear over the U.S. Cold War tactics at its finest.",

    "Answer": "When water evaporates, it gets heated to an extent that the water particles move faster and spread apart, which causes them to become \"lighter\" than the air around them, turning into water vapor, a gas. Due to this, they rise up into the atmosphere. Then, they start to cool down, and become liquid again. When they become cool enough that they're heavier than the air, it rains back down. This is the basic water cycle. The salt which makes it salt water requires a much higher temperature to turn into gas, one which doesn't normally happen during this cycle. Because of this, it does not follow the water, and thus, it doesn't rain salt water.",

    "Answer": "There are two kinds of spacing out. There is background processing - thinking about stuff that isn't apparent to you consciously, and basically resting your mind.  For most of evolutionary history, energy was the limiting factor for most species. Sleeping is not only helpful for repairing your body, but also for reducing your calorie burden. Spacing out is a kind of low energy state that is more alert than sleeping but less energy consuming than active thinking.",

    "Answer": "So the only way that the process of childbirth would change is through evolution of some kind. The only way evolution happens is if the genetically superior reproduce and those who aren’t die. Theoretically if there was a woman who could go through childbirth totally painlessly and she passed that trait on to her child, the child could pass the trait on and on until it made up the mass populous. This would take millions of years and to guarantee that all women experienced it, all who felt pain during childbirth would have to not reproduce.  Think about it like this. Apples were high on the tree. All the long necked giraffes reached the apples, lived and eventually reproduced. All the shortnecked giraffes died and that’s why we only today see long necked giraffes.",

    "Answer": "It's basically painting a transparent picture on top of the black-and-white, and the B/W image provides much of the shading.  In the days before photoshop, you had actual transparent inks with limited tints to choose from, and that's why old hand-colorized photos often look more cartoony. Now, you can pick from a vast range of colors until it more or less matches what you would expect: a white person with fair hair will probably have skin in X color range, unpainted wood furniture is going to be a shade of brown, jeans are almost certainly blue, a military uniform from that era is going to be this particular color, etc.  Plus if you have experience with B/W photography you might have a sense for how some colors will translate to film; they often have a particular range of grey due to the characteristics of a given film. So accurate colorizing mostly comes down to digital painting skill and having a sense for how things would look.",

    "Answer": "> This makes no sense because downloads are not limited like physical copies of books are. Downloads are limited in the sense that the library has to pay for every copy of a book that they own, including digital copies. So they pay the publisher $X for permission to lend some fixed number of digital copies. And the reader software is set up to that the borrower isn't able to retain possess of that copy forever. If that weren't the case, then book sales would drop essentially to nothing, since everyone could just get a free copy of any book whenever they wanted for as long as they wanted.",

Explain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\n3. Please provide a reference for your answer.\nAnswer: The question states that there are multiple courses of action (all of which will likely result in human injury) and the self-driving car is to determine which course to take.\nThe first thing that the self-driving car should do is to determine the location of the human beings. This is the most important step because if the car is unable to find the humans then it will not be able to take any action.\nThe next step is to determine the speed of the car. This is important because if the car is travelling at a high speed then it will be difficult for the car to stop in time.\nThe next step is to determine the distance between the car and the humans. This is important because if the car is too close to the humans then it will be difficult for the car to avoid them.\nThe next step is to determine the direction in which the humans are moving. This is important because if the humans are moving in the same direction as the car then it will be difficult for the car to avoid them.\nThe next step is to determine the speed of the humans.

    "Answer": "\"The answer hinges on the fact that spicy foods excite the receptors in the skin that normally respond to heat. Those receptors are pain fibers, technically known as polymodal nociceptors. They respond to temperature extremes and to intense mechanical stimulation, such as pinching and cutting; they also respond to certain chemical influences. The central nervous system can be confused or fooled when these pain fibers are stimulated by a chemical, like that in chile peppers, which triggers an ambiguous neural response.\" Source: _URL_0_",

    "Answer": "Generally yes, anything generated by an algorithm can be reproduced if you know the \"initial\" settings. Numbers generated this way are referred to as \"psuedorandom\".  There do, however, exist various dedicated hardware solutions that allow computers to pick truly random numbers. They work by basically installing in the computer some sort of sensor that can detect random properties of nature.  An example might be some sort of detector that picks up low levels of radiation. While we can make statistical predictions of radioactive decay over time, the actual decay of individual particles is truly random, and cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy. A sensor designed to measure those tiny random variations and feed them to a computer could generate truly random numbers.",

    "Answer": "Scar tissue is different to normal skin. It contains more collagen than regular tissue, and doesn't structure the same as regular skin, which is why it looks so different. It's also less flexible. The benefits to having scar tissue is the body can recover from wounds exceptionally quickly - many animals can't create scar tissue, and so wounds can remain open longer and are more susceptible to infection and other problems. Conversely, other animals can regenerate entire limbs whereas we can't. Interestingly, the collagen in your scar tissue is constantly replaced. If your body stops producing collagen (due to certain illnesses), your scars' wounds can actually reopen. The scar is difficult to get rid of because the tissue has been created in a less structured/ordered form than your regular skin (because it was deployed quickly to help heal the wound), but some medical procedures exist to reduce that effect.",

    "output": "1) The price of crude oil is the primary factor in determining the price of gasoline. 2) When the price of crude oil rises, the cost of producing gasoline rises, and gas stations pass this cost increase on to consumers in the form of higher prices. 3) The price of crude oil is determined by supply and demand, which can be affected by various factors, such as global economic conditions, political instability, and weather-related disruptions to production. 4) When the price of crude oil falls, the cost of producing gasoline also falls, but gas stations may not immediately pass this cost decrease on to consumers in the form of lower prices. 5) This is because gas stations often have to pay for gasoline in advance, and it can take time for them to adjust their prices to reflect the lower cost of crude oil. 6) Additionally, gas stations may also have to pay for other expenses, such as taxes and transportation costs, which can make it difficult for them to pass on the full benefit of a lower cost of crude oil to consumers in the form of lower gas prices. 7) Therefore, when the price of crude oil falls, gas stations may take longer to adjust their prices, and consumers may not see the full benefit of lower gas prices immediately.\nQuestion: Why do people say the price of gas is high when it is actually the price of crude oil that is high?\nAnswer: People often say that the price of gas is high when the price of crude oil is high because the price of gasoline is closely tied to the price of crude oil. Crude oil is the primary ingredient in the production of gasoline, and the cost of producing gasoline rises when the price of crude oil rises. This cost increase is passed on to consumers in the form of higher gas prices. Therefore, when people say that the price of gas is high, they are referring to the price of gasoline, which is directly affected by the price of crude oil.\nQuestion: Why is it that when oil prices go down the price of gasoline stays the same for a while?\nAnswer: 1) The price of gasoline is closely tied to the price of crude oil, which is the primary ingredient in the production of gasoline. 2) When the price of crude oil falls, the cost of producing gasoline also falls, but gas stations may not immediately pass this cost decrease on to consumers in the form of lower gas prices. 3) This is because gas stations often have to pay for gasoline in advance, and it can take time for them to adjust their prices to reflect the lower cost of crude oil. 4) Additionally, gas stations may also have to pay for other expenses, such as taxes and transportation costs, which can make it difficult for them to pass on the full benefit of a lower cost of crude oil to consumers in the form of lower gas prices. 5) Therefore, when the price of crude oil falls, gas stations may take longer to adjust their prices, and consumers may not see the full benefit of lower gas prices immediately.\nQuestion: Why is it that when the price of oil goes up the price of gasoline goes up immediately but when the price of oil goes down the price of gasoline doesn't go down as fast?\nAnswer: 1) The price of crude oil is the primary factor in determining the price of gasoline. 2) When the price of crude oil rises, the cost of producing gasoline rises, and gas stations pass this cost increase on to consumers in the form of higher prices. 3) The price of crude oil is determined by supply and demand, which can be affected by various factors, such as global economic conditions, political instability, and weather-related disruptions to production. 4) When the price of crude oil falls, the cost of producing gasoline also falls, but gas stations may not immediately pass this cost decrease on to consumers in the form of lower gas prices. 5) This is because gas stations often have to pay for gasoline in advance, and it can take time for them to adjust their prices to reflect the lower cost of crude oil. 6) Additionally, gas stations may also have to pay for other expenses, such as taxes and transportation costs, which can make it difficult for them to pass on the full benefit of a lower cost of crude oil to consumers in the form of lower gas prices. 7) Therefore, when the price of crude oil falls, gas stations may take longer to adjust their prices, and consumers may not see the full benefit",
    "Answer": "On TV, when the price of gas goes up, they say they have no choice but to sell it higher in gas stations too. But when the price goes down, they say that they had already bought a lot of gas when it was higher so they cannot lower the prices immediately or they'd lose money on it. There is probably a good explanation for it but my guess is that it's another of these \"Heads I win, Tails, you lose\" situation ;)",

    "Answer": "A home equity loan is a loan that is based off the difference between the value of the house and the current balance of the primary mortage. If you paid $50,000 for a house that's worth $75,000, you can get $25,000 in equity loans.  Subsequently, if your house was worth $75K when you bought it and it's now worth $135K because reasons, you can now get that much more in your equity loan. In theory, you don't have to wait at all to get a loan.

    "Answer": "It's usually not noticeable unless you sniff harshly, but one nostril is usually more open and free-flowing than the other.  The nostril that's closed usually swaps back and forth after several hours throughout the day. When a nostril is more closed, it's swollen, because the blood vessels inside the nose are swollen.  During that time, your immune system attacks all the nasty stuff that came into your nose. It's harder to breathe when that happens. But your other nostril is wide open and maximum air comes in.  This combination of having one closed nostril and one open nostril is a super efficient way for your body to both clean the nasties and breathe full air at the same time. If it was all just 1 nostril, then every few hours you would have difficulty breathing.  Air breathed through the nostrils are combined in the back and flow into both longs. One nostril does not lead into one lung.",

    "Answer": "Not an expert in the topic but I have some knowledge Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing as it represents a flow of money. This is why the average lifestyle in America is comfortably more lavish than those of in China. This is made possible because Americans are in better position to take out large loans and pay them back in the future. If all the debt were to be wiped out then that would mean banks would lose a very high percentage of income. Heres where my knowledge stops as my train of thought has been limited to what I know.",

    "Answer": "Ha, had the speakers on when I played that audio clip and the cat **freaked** out. Apparently that knock knock fools animals into thinking someone's at the front door too. Your brain determines the location of a sound's source by a few different factors. Namely, distortion differences between each ear, and delay in which ear hears the sound first. Technology has gotten good enough that with proper equipment it can re-create those effects and trick your brain. We usually use the term \"binaural\" as in \"Two ear\" to describe the effect. One of the most famous examples of binaurual audio is the \"Virtual haircut\" clip _URL_1_ where they demo a technology designed to create the effect. Lots of ASMR artists and other people do it too, one popular device these days is [a 3Dio twin mic setup such as this](_URL_0_). With two microphones and extremely accurate recreation of the human ear shape (it affects how sound bounces about), you can recreate a whole room's soundscape effectively.",

    "Answer": "When you cut down highly developed forests to replace them with cultivated land you're seriously lowering the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed. A big tree that is several decades old will take in WAY more CO2 than several seedlings that are planted to replace it. Additionally, all of the undergrowth that is in forests absorbs CO2 but that is all removed for farming. Further, a lot of the time what's done is called \"slash and burn\" which means that the forests are chopped down and the debris is cleared away via a controlled fire, once again adding CO2 (and other harmful chemicals) to the atmosphere. Also, removing well established plants will significantly increase soil erosion and while that may not directly contribute to global warming, it certainly is detrimental to the environment.",

    "output": "1. Lactose intolerance is a digestive condition that causes gastrointestinal symptoms after consuming lactose, which is a sugar found in milk and other dairy products.\n2. When lactose-intolerant individuals ingest lactose, it is not fully broken down and absorbed in the small intestine, as it normally would be in people with normal lactase levels.\n3. Instead, the undigested lactose passes into the large intestine, where it is fermented by bacteria, causing gas, bloating, and other symptoms.\n4. This process can lead to a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, including abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, and flatulence.\n5. The severity of these symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and can range from mild discomfort to severe abdominal pain and cramps.\n6. In some cases, lactose intolerance can lead to more serious health problems, such as malnutrition and anemia, if the individual is unable to consume enough calories and nutrients from other sources.\n7. The exact cause of lactose intolerance is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\n8. Some people are born with a reduced ability to produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose in the small intestine.\n9. Others may develop lactose intolerance after an injury or infection to the small intestine, or as a result of certain diseases or medications.\n10. Lactose intolerance can be diagnosed through a variety of tests, including a hydrogen breath test, which measures the amount of hydrogen in the breath after consuming lactose.\n11. Treatment for lactose intolerance typically involves avoiding or reducing the consumption of lactose-containing foods, and taking lactase enzyme supplements or lactose-free milk products.\n12. However, some individuals may choose to continue consuming small amounts of lactose-containing foods, and manage their symptoms through dietary modifications and lifestyle changes.\n13. It is important to note that lactose intolerance is not a life-threatening condition, but it can significantly impact an individual's quality of life and daily activities.\n14. Therefore, it is important for individuals with lactose intolerance to work closely with their healthcare provider to manage their symptoms and maintain a healthy and balanced diet.\n15. Overall, lactose intolerance is a common digestive condition that can cause a variety of gastrointestinal symptoms, and it is important for individuals to be aware of their personal tolerance for lactose and to make appropriate dietary modifications as needed.",
    "Answer": "So, from what I've understood in the past, people who are lactose-intolerant aren't able to break down lactose. Their body doesn't produce enough lactase, which is an enzyme that breaks down lactose. So, depending on how much lactose is taken in, it usually is broken down by bacteria instead in the gut. This causes a bunch of side effects like, nausea, bloating, gas, and stomach cramps.",

    "Answer": "Caveat - I mess with boats but I'm not expert or pro. In general marine equipment is made with more corrosion resistant materials,such as stainless steel. The A/C on my boat exchanges the heat in the cabin air into water that flows through the other side of the heat pump, so this is an air/water heat pump where most home units are air/air heat pumps. Also some or most marine units are 12 Volt DC power, possibly also 24 volt. I think some few are powered directly off the engine via a 'fan belt'. The reefer on my boat is three way power - 120 VAC, 12 VDC, and propane. I suppose this would be possible in A/C but I've ever heard of this.",

    "Answer": "I see two reasons: 1. In most European countries you need a residence permit to open a bank account. In other words, you must live in the country where you want the bank account. Some countries, like Switzerland, allow foreigners to open bank accounts without a permit. However, the banking fees are high for such customers ( > 800$ per year). Unless people have substantial amounts of money ( > 100,000$) the fees will erase their savings. As it happens, many people in Ukraine are not very wealthy. 2. It is difficult. You need to go abroad, speak a foreign language, spend significant amount of time and money. Most don't bother.",

    "Answer": "There are several reasons. The salt in the ocean lowers the temperature needed to make it freeze. Currents stop the ice from bonding, and if Ice did freeze, it is less dense and floats. But the main reason is the pressure, especially in deep water. To freeze, water needs to expand. Deep in the ocean, the pressure from the water stops it from being able to expand.",

    "Answer": "Nuclear Winter is not a local effect resulting from an atomic blast, but rather a hypothetical effect from lots of nukes going off. The theory is that the nukes would kick a lot of soot and dust up in to the air, blocking out the sun. The blocking out of the sun would result in lower temperatures since the sun can't heat up as much of the Earth anymore. Some of the effects are based on similar effects felt when a large volcano goes off. Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines went off in the early 90's and we only saw a slight drop in temperature (1 degree F).",

    "Answer": "How long do you want to take to accelerate? Merging onto the highway in a reasonable time takes far more power than maintaining a constant speed. There are plenty of 1.0 l cars for sale in Europe. They take about 17 +/- seconds to reach 100 kph, but they are very fuel efficient. No one would buy them here in the US because it would be frankly frightening to try to merge onto our freeways in a car that slow.",

    "Answer": "People have made it so. Words can be given such power based on how they're used in the culture. I remember when Austin Powers 2 came out (it was called Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me), and that was seen as quite vulgar for British people.  In the US, Shagged is a cute word (like using Poop in place of the word Shit). Just remember that it is how it is taken, not how it is intended. You could be using cunt like the Aussies do in friendly conversation (referring to their friends), but someone who isn't used to hearing that can still take offense to it.",

    "Answer": "Typically each twin controls a different part of the body. Like the twin girls Brittany and Abigail Hensel. They give the appearance of being one body with two heads, though they have two of each organ above the waist. They have two arms, each controlling one. And from the waist down, they have one body, with each controlling one half. So each controls a leg, for example. There doesn't appear to be any part that both of their brains controls. So they coordinate with each other so that they can walk, but they each have their own body parts they use. In some cases of animals with two heads, only one head \"works\". The other head doesn't seem to have any reactions to stimuli so it's vestigial.",

    "Answer": "1. AK-47's distance between the sight and post is very short which makes it so that for longer ranges, it is extremely difficult to line up an accurate shot as you are more likely to be misaligned with your eye to the sights. 2. It uses a relatively low velocity round, meaning it arcs more and spends more time to get to the target, making it deviate more from environmental conditions 3. Its feeding mechanism uses very large and heavy moving parts which reduces accuracy dramatically from recoil. 4. It has a more significant recoil upon firing due to its type of ammunition, making subsequent rounds less accurate. 5. It operates on a lot looser tolerances, while making it more reliable, also reduces its overall accuracy. 6. [Its gun barrel flexes more than other guns during recoil.](_URL_1_) Compare that with [this](_URL_2_), Or [this](_URL_0_) 7. The barrel isn't inline with the stock, making recoils want to push the gun upwards.",

    "Answer": "Memories enter the brain first as short term memory, that is then transformed into a long-term memory.  This is evident because the majority of short-term memories that we experience are lost before they ever make it into what we will call \"long-term\" storage.  When alcohol is consumed it affects your ability to take short-term memories and transform them into long-term memories.  This is why you only may remember small bits and pieces of the night, these are the select short-term memories that were allowed to settle into long-term ones without the interruption of alcohol. As the level of alcohol drops, the number of memories that make it into \"long-term' storage increases.",

    "Answer": "When the water ends up in the oceans, it slows down the cycling a lot. Water in aquifers (the stores under the ground that we access when we use wells) and water on Earth's surface are the cheapest to use. We have been either polluting these (surface) or using them too fast for new water to filter in. We have also allowed a lot of water to go to the ocean(storm water runoff from developed areas) , rather than slowly go into the aquifers through the ground. So the result is we are using aquifer water faster than they are getting refilled. When that water is depleted, all water will become more expensive. We will still have it, but it will either be salty, polluted, or far from where it needs to be, and all of the fixes for this cost money. Sorry if this isn't too coherent, I haven't finished my first cup of coffee for the day.",

    "Answer": "A lot of it is because the group tries to make its fans into a \"community\" (Juggalos). Like, fans of a band like, say, the Black Keys, are just people who happen to like the Black Keys. But ICP specifically encourages fans, \"Hey, dress up like us, be like us, be part of something,\" and then the fans encourage each other to do it too. People like that. They like feeling like they're part of a group. It's the same kind of thing with Lady Gaga and her \"Little Monsters,\" just a different type of music.",

    "Answer": "I believe it has something to do with the rate at which heat from your body is transferred to the material. Your body is hotter than both the fabric and the spoon, which are at the same temperature, but the spoon conducts the heat at a faster rate and so you feel it as being colder.

    "Answer": "The condition is called aphthous stomatitis, or commonly, canker sores. They are NOT inflamed tastebuds. Rather, they are small ulcers (areas of inflamed, healing tissue) that are characteristically painful and confined to the mucosa (soft tissue) of the mouth (including surface of the tongue) by definition. There is no cure, but many over-the-counter drugs are sold that can mitigate the pain caused by them. This question is by no means explained (moderators, hello?). Rather, the pathogenesis (how it develops) of an aphthous sore is still unknown. I couldn't believe it, but apparently this is an area of relatively active research.

    "Answer": "Swear words come from things we consider taboo or distasteful. In English-speaking society, we have a lot of taboos surrounding sex, even in this day and age. We also put a very high level of importance on hygiene, so words relating to waste and where they come from are also taboo.  Certain words automatically make your brain think of a subject in a more intense way than others. A colloquial term vs a scientific one. This is true for pretty much anything, even if it isn't a swearword -- sweat vs perspiration, for example. When it's a topic that's taboo, that word becomes a swear. When it isn't, it moves back into innocuous territory.",

    "Answer": "Straight in, stick to the top, two o clock (yes always) until about the second bend in your fingers, if you've hit your knuckles that's way too far. It all generally feels the same to you but it has sort of an interesting texture. So I know perhaps you've always been told to do the \"Come here\" motion but it's actually okay to be a little bit rougher than that, nearly all the nerves are located outside and in the clitoris. So use your dominant hand for entry and place the other hand palm down thumb towards you, gently but firmly across the lower pelvis. Use your two fingers with dominant hand to move entire fore arm in a controlled vibration sort of motion. Check with female on pressure and intensity. Use clitoral stimulation at your discretion. Hope that makes sense!",

    "Answer": "Because there isn't nothing there. Every spectrum is full of random noise from stars, radioactive decay, all sorts of things like that. It's just terrestrial broadcasts are so much stronger that it overwhelms the random noise.

    "Answer": "A bath is a time when dogs get much attention and get touched and scrubbed all over. A dog can become emotionally overwhelmed from this extreme attention.  Also, the situation of getting soaked to the skin is unusual for the dog, perhaps stressful, because their undercoat is an important protection to them. To get this undercoat wet \"against their will\" so to speak, while being restrained, can make them stress. These things can combine to overexcite the dog. To discharge this overexcitement, the dog may go apeshit - running, shaking water off, frenzied actions. In short, blowing off steam.",

    "Answer": "Warsaw was under Nazi rule. People didn't like that, especially the Jews living in the ghetto. People were purposely starved, killed in the streets. The Polish Underground State was formed - a resistance paramilitary which was made of several groups that wanted to liberate Poland (and save Jews).  Some folks with radios learned that the Red Army was coming. And the Reds hate the Nazis. And the Polish Resistance thought \"Hey! If we fight the Nazis from within - and the Reds help out - we'll totally fuck the Nazi shit up!\"  The Resistance started fighting - but the Red Army never came to help them. Those dudes camped outside the city. The Poles fought the Nazis for two months, much of the city was in ashes, and Churchill was all like \"HEY STALIN, COME HELP OUR POLISH ALLIES!\" and Stalin was kinda like, \"I don't want to risk my dudes quite yet..\" That's the Warsaw Uprising.",

    "Answer": "Just because it's \"widescreen\" doesn't mean that it's the same exact aspect ratio as your TV. A movie with black bars on the top and bottom was filmed in an aspect ration that's even wider than your widescreen TV.  Look [here](_URL_1_). Most widescreen TV's are 16:9 (the third from the bottom on that page), and many movies are filmed in 2.39:1 (the one on the very bottom). Clearly, you cannot shrink the bottom one to fit on a 16:9 screen without having bars at the top and bottom with no picture. Well, you can if you can tolerate a distorted, squished picture. Another option is to use [Pan and Scan](_URL_0_), which gets rid of the black bars at the expense of cutting off the sides of the picture.",

    "Answer": "When you make an outbound call, the calling system gives the phone system the caller ID information. The reason this can be (legitimately) different from the actual call is for example a business that has both direct lines to each extension and a main line. An employee calling out would show up with the main line as their caller ID so that if the person calls back they get the main number (this way you’re not giving out the direct number unless you needed to).  The spammers take advantage of this system to spoof a number in the caller ID.  The phone company could counter this by comparing the caller ID info with a number you legitimately own, but they get a lot of money for all these spam calls and they’re not incentivized enough to change how they do things.",

    "Answer": "This is just one example.  More grazing animals means less vegetation for other animals to use as a home or shelter from prey. They also took vegetation away from the river banks causing more erosion. (The roots held the soil in place) The reintroduction of wolves stopped that and kept the grazing animal population in check, allowing the vegetation to grow back.",

    "Answer": "\"President\" is a term that is often based on the law of the place where the company is created. For example in the United States, most states require that a corporation have a person with the title President. That title carries with it some legal obligations that tie the individual to the actions of the company. Most jurisdictions don't define or require anyone to hold the title \"Chief Executive Officer\".  Depending on the size of the entity, the President and the CEO may be the same person. Large entities may be comprised of several smaller companies, each with a legally required \"President\", who may report to the CEO at the top of the organizational structure. Some companies may separate the two titles for internal organizational reasons, for historical reasons, or because someone thinks it's clever. It is rare for a company to have a CEO who reports to a President. CEO has become the de facto title for \"the highest level of the executive ladder\", but that's arbitrary and fashion could change.",

    "Answer": "This is actually one of the major issues with American football. The padding protects from the blunt hit and spreads out the impact so you aren't taking a lot of force to a particular place on your body, but your body is still being shoved really hard as a whole. This means the force is spread out and absorbed a bit so your skeleton isn't taking such a direct impact, but since a body at rest tends to stay at rest, when you get hit, your organs like to stay where they are as your skeleton is forced to move and they bang around inside their cage.",

    "Answer": "It's because servers where traditionally named according to the services they provide. So a world wide web server had www., a file transfer protocol server had ftp., et caetera. We stopped having to type it because nowadays, the www._URL_0_ and _URL_0_ URLs both refer to the same server (URL is like a set of coordinates on a map that is given to your web browser to go and find the web site). Some sites don't, and so typing either form might yield different results. Most browsers also add the www. in automatically, to stop any problems that might occur.",

    "Answer": "The real numbers are all the numbers you grew up working with - 1,2,3,4, 4.5, 1/3, 1.2345, -27, 3.1415... and so on. When you limit yourself to the real numbers, the square root of -1 is undefined - there's just no possible number it can be. To get around this, mathematicians defined **i** as the square root of -1. Giving you `i * i = -1`. Imaginary numbers are any real number multiplied by **i** : i, 2i, 3i, 4i, 4.5i, i/3, 1.2345\\*i, -27i, 3.1415...\\*i and so on. Then you also have the *complex numbers* which are made up of *both* real & imaginary parts - things like `(2.5 + 3i)`. Really, anything of the form `(a + bi)` where a & b are real numbers.",

    "Answer": "Odds basically tell you that if the exact same situation were to occur an infinite number of times, what portion of those times would lead to that specific result. e.g. If you have the Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, Queen of Hearts and Jack of Hearts in your hand and 48 shuffled cards in front of you, there is a 1 in 48 chance you will end up with a 10 of hearts for a Royal Flush. There is no way of guessing which card will come up next, but if you shuffled that deck drew a card (made note of which card it was, replaced it and repeat) millions of times, you would get the Royal Flush 1/48 of the time. A pro would make that bet if it pays better than 48 times their money. They will only win 1/48 of the time, but if they get the chance to make that bet many many times in their lives, the rare win will make up for the cost of the losses.",

    "Answer": "By default, after you die, everything will go to your legal next of kin. That person (or persons) is defined in this order, and if you don't have a living member of each group, it passes to the next one down: Spouse Children Parents Siblings I believe that next comes grandkids, then grandparents, but don't quote me on that. So if you don't have a spouse, but you have 3 kids and 2 parents living, your property would be split between your kids by default. And they'd inherit debts and things as well. A will exists to change these defaults. Say you have a spouse, but you still want to make sure that certain things go to your kids, your will would enumerate \"Hey, my kids get this, this and this, and my spouse gets whatever I didn't list.\"",

    "Answer": "Weight gain is dependent on calories in and calories burned. It doesn't matter where you're getting those calories from, if you burn them all through activity and lifestyle, then you're not going to put on weight. Olympic Swimmer Michael Phelps ate somewhere around 2000 Calories for breakfast (remember watching a documentary - his breakfast had eggs, bacon, sausages, waffles with syrup, etc). My only concern about your diet would be that your lack of fruits and vegetables could mean you're risking various vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin C, A, B12, K, etc. Not to mention you might not be getting that much fibre and depending on what exactly it is you eat, your cholesterol level could suffer.",

    "Answer": "A calorie is a physical measure of energy - specifically, the amount of energy needed to heat one metric mililitre of water by one degree Celsius. Energy in food intake is also measured in this way, though the terms kilocalorie and calorie are often used interchangably, which can cause confusion.  But yes, no matter where it comes from, one calorie always represents the exact same amount of energy. However, a difference you *can* make is that some foods will allow the energy that is within them to be absorbed more efficiently or more quickly, which can lead to varying results. (Edit courtesy of Neo6874: One calorie heats one millilitre by one degree Celsius. One kilocalorie heats one litre by one degree Celsius.)",

    "Answer": "The water in the lake came from somewhere. Most lakes are fed by rivers and streams, or were originally parts of a river network as is the case with [oxbow lakes.](_URL_0_) A lake that was completely isolated from any other sources of water would eventually see evolutionary divergence if it had unique stressors, but there aren't many, if any, lakes like that, at least aboveground. Also a lot of lake and river fisheries are stocked by humans. Like, you'll find largemouth bass in a lot of fisheries around the world, it's especially popular in Japan, but largemouth bass are only native to North America.

    "Answer": "Gonna get a little technical:    The movie has a digital equivalence of around 8192x2968 (assuming a 4K equivalence for regular 4-perf 35mm). I don't know of any theater that has a projector above 4K, many are even at 2K (2048x1080, almost the same as regular 1920x1080, as most movies are 2K).   So, seeing it in a theater with 4K projection is the next best thing (at basically 50% the \"resolution\").   Movies like Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Star Wars Ep VII (only one scene though), etc. are even bigger because they are 70mm IMAX, which is around 11800x8192. I saw both Interstellar and Star Wars Ep VII in this format and it what great, Interstellar took the cake though in terms of how amazing it was visually/immersively.",

    "Answer": "60 is easy to divide cleanly in multiple ways, and a number based on 60, such as the number of degrees in a circle, can be divided yet more ways. 60 can be divided by 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 and itself. This provides many easy-to-reckon, useful fractions. In the days before pocket calculators, slide rules, Napier's Bones, etc. this made life simpler.",

    "Answer": "When the water hits your taste buds, they are stimulated a little. The problem is they have been overloaded with sugar and acid, thus they are temporarily unable to *report* sugar and acid at that moment. Therefore they report the only thing left: alkaline (bitter) taste. Add that to the fact that most water has dissolved minerals in it that make it ever-so-slightly alkaline.",

    "Answer": "**NOT ELI5** The car's driveshaft also powers a *speedometer cable*, which spins a magnet around at the same speed inside the *speed cup*. This magnet rotates continually in an equal direction. This spinning creates a fluctuating magnetic field. The laws of electromagnetism dictate that a current must therefore flow inside this cup. This current causes the speed cup to also rotate. It attempts to catch up with the speed of the magnet. a *hairspring* stops this, so it only rotates a little. This small motion moves the dial on the speedometer a little. The stronger the current, the faster the cup rotates, the further the speedometer's dial moves.  & nbsp; **ELI5** The driveshaft powers a speedometer cable, which leads to a magnet rotating inside a cup. A current is generated, and the cup tries to rotate also. A spring limits this, moving the dial. More current = more speed = dial moves further.",

    "output": "1. The psychological term for when you finish a game/book/series and feel empty inside is Post-endgame depression.\n2. Post-endgame depression is a term used to describe the feeling of emptiness and sadness that a person may experience after completing a game, book, or series.\n3. This phenomenon is not limited to video games, but can also occur after reading a book or completing a TV series.\n4. The reason for this phenomenon is not fully understood, but it is thought to be due to the fact that the person has invested a lot of time and energy into the game, book, or series and has become attached to the characters and the world that they have created.\n5. When the game, book, or series is over, the person may feel a sense of loss and sadness as they are no longer able to experience the same level of enjoyment and excitement that they did when they were actively engaged in the game, book, or series.\n6. This feeling can be especially intense if the game, book, or series was particularly engaging or if the person has become emotionally attached to the characters and the world.\n7. Post-endgame depression can be a difficult experience to manage, but there are ways to cope with it.\n8. Some people find that it helps to take a break from the game, book, or series for a while and then come back to it later.\n9. Others find that it helps to engage in other activities that they enjoy, such as reading, playing sports, or spending time with friends and family.\n10. Ultimately, the best way to cope with post-endgame depression is to find ways to stay engaged in the world of the game, book, or series and to find new ways to enjoy it.\n11. This may include joining a fan club, participating in online forums, or reading fan fiction.\n12. With time and effort, it is possible to manage post-endgame depression and continue to enjoy the game, book, or series.\n13.

    "Answer": "Your bladder only sends the \"time to pee\" message to your brain when it reaches a certain level of fullness. So the amount you pee out doesn't just represent the glass of water you just drank, but all of the water you have drank since the last time you peed plus the water your body needed to dissolve the waste products it excretes in urine (urea, creatine and some other compounds).",

    "output": "1. A single-stranded DNA molecule is highly entropic, with a large number of possible conformations. This means that the molecule is flexible and can assume many different shapes.\n2. DNA molecules are also highly charged, with a negative charge on the backbone and a positive charge on the phosphate groups. This charge allows the molecule to repel itself, preventing it from tangling.\n3. Finally, DNA molecules are highly organized, with a specific sequence of nucleotides. This organization allows the molecule to fold into a specific shape, which prevents it from tangling.\n4. Overall, the combination of these three factors prevents DNA from getting tangled.\nAnswer: DNA is a long, thin molecule that is coiled up like a string.

    "Answer": "Proteins!  There are *many, many* proteins in your body that have a specific job of keeping your DNA tangled/condensed the perfect amount. There are topoisomerases, a family of proteins, that specifically twist/untwist your DNA to introduce/remove \"supercoils\" (like what would happn when you twist an elastic band) to condense it or expand it. There are some proteins like histones to which the DNA will almost always be attached. The histones kind of serve as a backbone for the DNA; a place for the DNA to organize itself.  Of course, this is just the very basic level of proteins. There are many more proteins and ways to organize DNA. It's always proteins!",

    "Answer": "Child support is partially based on income. It is also partially based on the number of children and their age, the cost of basic living expenses and school in that general area, and whether or not any special needs are present. Which sometimes leads to a very high ratio, but that is also something that can happen when both parents live with their children; not all jobs pay a wage that covers a child's reasonable expenses. That doesn't mean those expenses don't occur though.",

Also, he added in a bunch of CG aliens that didn't fit, put back in a deleted scene with Jabba the Hutt that wasn't necessary, added cheesy special effects to the Death Star explosion, added in a fucking song and dance number to Return of the Jedi, replaced the original ending of Jedi and added in Hayden Christiansen. He basically tinkered with it unnecessarily and added in a bunch of crappy looking CG aliens and effects. edit: cheese=cheesy",

    "output": "1) Blankets work by trapping a layer of air between them and the body. The air is warmed by the body and thus provides a layer of insulation.\n2) A blanket can be made from a variety of materials, including wool, cotton, and polyester. Wool is a natural insulator, while cotton and polyester are man-made materials that are also good insulators. The type of material used in a blanket affects its ability to insulate, with wool being the best insulator.\n3) The weight and thickness of a blanket also affect its ability to insulate. A thicker blanket will provide more insulation than a thinner one. A heavier blanket will also provide more insulation than a lighter one.\n4) The color of a blanket also affects its ability to insulate. A darker color will absorb more heat than a lighter color.\n5) The size of a blanket also affects its ability to insulate. A larger blanket will provide more insulation than a smaller one.\n6) The shape of a blanket also affects its ability to insulate. A rectangular or square blanket will provide more insulation than a round or oval one.\n7) The way a blanket is folded also affects its ability to insulate. A blanket that is folded in half will provide more insulation than one that is folded in thirds.\n8) The way a blanket is used also affects its ability to insulate. A blanket that is used to cover the body will provide more insulation than one that is used to cover the head.\n9) The way a blanket is stored also affects its ability to insulate. A blanket that is stored in a cool, dry place will provide more insulation than one that is stored in a hot, humid place.\n10) The way a blanket is used also affects its ability to insulate. A blanket that is used to cover the body will provide more insulation than one that is used to cover the head.\n11) The way a blanket is stored also affects its ability to insulate.

    "output": "1) Both Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims believe in the same God, Muhammad is the messenger of God, and the Qur'an is the word of God.\n2) The main difference between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims is that the Shi'ites believe that the prophet Muhammad's cousin, Ali, should have been the first caliph (or leader) of Islam.\n3) Sunnis believe that the first caliph should have been Abu Bakr, Muhammad's father-in-law, and that the caliph should have been chosen by a council of Muslim leaders, not by Muhammad's family.\n4) Shi'ites also believe that the imam (leader) of the Islamic community should be descended from Muhammad through his daughter Fatima and Ali.\n5) Sunnis believe that the imam should be chosen by a council of Muslim leaders, not by Muhammad's family.\n6) The other major difference between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims is that Shi'ites believe in a series of 12 imams who are descended from Muhammad and Ali, while Sunnis believe that the imams should be chosen by a council of Muslim leaders, not by Muhammad's family.\n7) The Shi'ites also believe in the concept of the Mahdi, a messianic figure who is descended from Muhammad and Ali and who will bring justice to the world. Sunnis do not believe in the Mahdi.\n8) The Shi'ites also believe in the concept of the Qiyamah, a day of judgment when all people will be judged by God. Sunnis do not believe in the Qiyamah.\n9) Sunnis and Shi'ites also differ in their interpretation of the Qur'an. Shi'ites believe that the Qur'an should be interpreted according to the teachings of Muhammad and Ali, while Sunnis believe that the Qur'an should be interpreted according to the teachings of the Qur'an and the Sunnah (the sayings and actions of Muhammad).\n10) Shi'ites also believe in the concept of the \"Hidden Imam,\" a messianic figure who is descended from Muhammad and Ali and who is currently in hiding.

    "Answer": "Shi'ites think that leadership in Islam should be hereditary, and that Imams more or less represent the authority of the founder through his bloodline. Sunnis think that leadership in Islam should be by some sort of democratic process, and you don't need to be a descendant of the founder to hold authority. It started out that way when the movement had to decide on how to continue after the death of its founder. Pretty soon, through in-fighting and because that is the way things go in a closely knit community, everybody and his uncle also had an opinion that would be forced upon the community.

    "Answer": "It depends on the context, but I'll stick to your examples. People didn't view still photographs on photographic film. They needed to be printed on photographic paper. Slides are an exception, but they didn't get popular until later.  Motion picture film is negative and printed onto another piece of film to make a positive for viewing via a projector. Many people view magnified motion picture film, but most people never view still photo negatives.  This is may not be the etymology, but it makes sense, and that's what your looking for.",

    "output": "1. How do broadcasters sell and maximize advertising revenue during live sports when they don't know how many commercial breaks there will be?\n2. Explain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nBroadcasters sell and maximize advertising revenue during live sports by providing a fixed number of commercial breaks, and then charging advertisers a fixed price per commercial break. This allows advertisers to plan their advertising strategy in advance, and to budget for their advertising costs. Additionally, this method allows broadcasters to maximize their revenue by charging a higher price for the commercial breaks that occur during the most popular and/or high-profile games.\nTo explain this answer in more detail, we can break it down into two main steps:\n1. Broadcasters sell and maximize advertising revenue during live sports by providing a fixed number of commercial breaks.\nThis is the first step in the process, and it involves the broadcasters determining the number of commercial breaks that will occur during the live sporting event. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as by analyzing the length of the game and the expected level of viewer engagement, or by consulting with advertisers to determine their preferences.\nOnce the number of commercial breaks has been determined, the broadcasters can begin to sell advertising slots during these breaks. This can be done in a variety of ways, such as by offering a set number of slots to advertisers, or by offering advertisers the opportunity to purchase a certain number of slots at a set price.\n2. Broadcasters sell and maximize advertising revenue during live sports by charging advertisers a fixed price per commercial break.\nThis is the second step in the process, and it involves the broadcasters setting a fixed price for each commercial break.

    "Answer": "Many infections grow best at particularly precise temperatures. Your body raises your temperature as a defense mechanism, slowing down the reproduction of the infectious agent and giving your own defenses a chance to 'catch up'. At the same time it enhances the ability of some of your body's defenders to move around more actively in their war.",

    "Answer": "The almond flavour you taste in almond paste, marzipan and so forth comes from an aromatic called benzaldehyde. This is found in *bitter* almonds, which also have a fairly hefty amount of cyanide; the latter is removed during the extraction of the benzaldehyde. The almonds you eat in nut form are *sweet* almonds, which contain a much lower level of benzaldehyde, and, luckily enough, cyanide as well. Benzaldehyde is also present in apricots, cherries, and peaches, which is why they all have similar taste profiles.",

Turns out I wasn't getting the pill \"stuck\" in my throat exactly, but I was not swallowing them with enough water.  When someone swallows pills without proper salivation or lubricant the object can \"scrape\" itself on the back of your throat, leaving you with that heavy and sometimes painful feeling that doesn't go away for a while. It may feel like it's lodged in there, which could be possible, but it's most likely just pain from the pills contact.  Long story short, always drink water before and with pills.",

However, men tend to be more likely to be promoted to higher-paying positions. Women are also more likely than men to take extended time off or work part time while raising a family, meaning their careers are held back during that time.",

    "Answer": "Industrial electric motors are meant to be run nearly 24/7 at higher loads and don't have to be portable, so size isn't usually a factor as much as keeping them cool, so they're built to shed excess heat better, and more surface are = more heat that can be transferred away. on the other hand for cars, weight and size are bigger factors, and the motors in them will never be run full power all the time, so more effort is put into them to keep them smaller. Heat dissipation isn't as much of a problem either in a car as you can use the cars air flow to help keep things cool, whereas industrial motors don't usually sit in well ventilated areas.",

    "Answer": "Large road projects usually exist to keep the existing road network running, or to improve its relation to the rest of the city. Bridges need to be retrofitted, underpasses capped, tarmac replaced. They may be big projects, but they're really necessary to keep the system functioning like it is. A major public transportation network is an entirely new investment. If you don't do it, you don't it--there's no downside other than that you don't have the network. A comparable project would be the construction of an entirely new highway link (or in some cities, the removal of major highways), which is rare and nowadays often put to voters as well. Of note is that many major highway projects were initiated in a time when referendums for transportation were not as common.",

    "Answer": "Bluetooth is designed to be short-range very low-power for small portable equipment. Part of the power-savings of Bluetooth come from diminished bandwidth (just as much as the weaker signal).

    "output": "200 million years ago, the supercontinent Pangea split into two, forming Laurasia in the north and Gondwana in the south. The continents began to move apart, and the oceans began to form. This process of continental drift continued for millions of years, and the Earth's continents have continued to move apart ever since.\nThe continental drift caused a number of changes to the Earth's environment. For example, it created new landmasses, which allowed for the evolution of new species. It also caused changes in the Earth's climate, which led to the development of new ecosystems.\nThe continental drift also had a profound impact on the evolution of humans. When the continents split, the human population was divided into two groups. One group remained in Africa, while the other group moved to Eurasia. This separation caused the two groups to evolve differently. The African group continued to evolve into Homo sapiens, while the Eurasian group evolved into Neanderthals and Denisovans.\nThe separation of Pangea also had a profound impact on the evolution of other species. For example, it caused the evolution of new species of animals and plants in different parts of the world. It also caused the extinction of some species, as they were unable to adapt to the new environment.\nIn conclusion, the separation of Pangea had a profound impact on the evolution of humans and other species. It caused the evolution of new species, the extinction of some species, and the development of new ecosystems.\nQuestion: How did humans evolve in a way that allowed them to spread all over the world?\nAnswer: The evolution of humans is a complex process that involves many factors. One of the key factors in the evolution of humans is the ability to adapt to new environments. This ability has allowed humans to spread all over the world.\nOne of the key factors in the evolution of humans is the ability to adapt to new environments. This ability has allowed humans to spread all over the world. Humans have been able to adapt to a wide variety of environments, from the hot and humid tropics to the cold and arid deserts. This ability has allowed humans to live in almost every part of the world.\nAnother factor in the evolution of humans is the ability to communicate with each other. This ability has allowed humans to form complex societies and to cooperate with each other. This ability has allowed humans to live in groups and to work together to achieve common goals.\nThe evolution of humans is a complex process that involves many factors. One of the key factors in the evolution of humans is the ability to adapt to new environments. This ability has allowed humans to spread all over the world. Another factor in the evolution of humans is the ability to communicate with each other. This ability has allowed humans to form complex societies and to cooperate with each other. The evolution of humans is a fascinating process that is still being studied by scientists today.\nQuestion: How did humans evolve from apes?\nAnswer: The evolution of humans from apes is a complex process that involves many factors. One of the key factors is the development of the brain. The human brain is much larger and more complex than the brain of an ape. This allows humans to think and reason in ways that apes cannot.\nAnother important factor in the evolution of humans from apes is the development of the skeleton. The human skeleton is much more flexible and able to adapt to different environments than the skeleton of an ape. This allows humans to move and adapt to different environments in ways that apes cannot.\nThe evolution of humans from apes is a complex process that involves many factors. The development of the brain and the skeleton are two of the most important factors. These factors allow humans to think and reason in ways that apes cannot, and to move and adapt to different environments in ways that apes cannot.\nQuestion: How did humans evolve from fish?\nAnswer: The evolution of humans from fish is a complex process that involves many factors. One of the key factors is the development of the brain. The human brain is much more complex than the brain of a fish, and this allows humans to think and reason in ways that fish cannot.\nAnother important factor in the evolution of humans from fish is the development of the skeleton. The human skeleton is much more flexible and able to support the weight of the human body than the skeleton of a fish. This allows humans to move and adapt to different environments in ways that fish cannot.\nThe evolution of humans from fish is a complex process that involves many factors.

    "output": "1. Canadian healthcare is different from Obamacare because it is a single-payer system where the government pays for all healthcare expenses, while Obamacare is a multi-payer system where the government, employers, and individuals all contribute to healthcare costs.\n2. In Canada, all citizens and permanent residents are eligible for free or low-cost healthcare, while in the US, Obamacare only covers a certain percentage of the population and leaves many without insurance.\n3. In Canada, the government sets healthcare prices and reimburses providers based on those prices, while in the US, healthcare prices are set by private insurers and can vary widely.\n4. In Canada, healthcare is funded through taxes, while in the US, Obamacare is funded through a combination of taxes and premiums paid by individuals and employers.\n5. In Canada, healthcare is provided through a network of public and private providers, while in the US, healthcare is provided through a mix of public and private providers, with the majority being private.\n6. In Canada, healthcare is regulated by the government and is subject to strict quality standards, while in the US, healthcare is regulated by the government but is less regulated than in Canada.\n7. In Canada, the government negotiates drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, while in the US, drug prices are set by private companies and can be much higher than in Canada.\n8. In Canada, healthcare is funded through a progressive tax system, where higher-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes, while in the US, Obamacare is funded through a regressive tax system, where lower-income earners pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes.\n9. In Canada, healthcare is a universal right for all citizens and permanent residents, while in the US, Obamacare is not a universal right and many people still cannot afford healthcare.\n10. In Canada, healthcare is funded through a nationalized system, where the government controls the healthcare system, while in the US, Obamacare is funded through a mix of public and private insurers, with the majority being private.\n11. In Canada, healthcare is funded through a single-payer system, where the government pays for all healthcare expenses, while in the US, Obamacare is funded through a multi-payer system, where the government, employers, and individuals all contribute to healthcare costs.\n12.

    "Answer": "Canadian healthcare is, more or less, single-payer. Basically, you pay a tax to the government and the government insures you. American healthcare is a big old mess. We have single-payer for some people (Medicare), full-on nationalized healthcare for some (the Veterans' administration, where doctors are government employees), private insurance for many, and no insurance (fuck you and die) for some.  Obamacare is actually working--it's fixing some of the worst problems with private insurance and reducing the number of people with no insurance. But our health care system is still a big old mess. Obamacare didn't create the mess, but it does sort of freeze it in place. If you want more detail, I created a comic to explain Obamacare here: _URL_0_.",

    "Answer": "If you're referring to the time gap between Android and iOS releases, the answer is because of Apple. Things get on the Android market very easily and quickly, because the Android market is cool. Apple has dozens of excessive rules and guidelines that they strictly enforce, so they actually look through the app/code. This takes time, so they usually push the update to Android and iOS at the same time, and Apple takes forever to approve. edit: of course this doesn't mean that Android doesn't have or enforce guidelines. They just aren't ridiculous like Apple's.",

    "Answer": "Simply expressing support would not be sufficient to try someone for treason even back in war times. That would be deeply unpopular, but not treason unless you'd do something *material* in regards to the enemy war effort. For example, you can look at organizations like German American Bund or British Union of Fascists. In general, their organized activities were prohibited during the war and leaders were detained for various issues; but the detained people, as a rule, were not tried for treason and the vast majority of their members (tens of thousands of them!) weren't tried for anything ever.",

    "output": "1. Inbreeding is a practice of mating between close relatives, such as siblings or cousins. It is a common practice in some parts of the world, such as rural areas where there are limited options for marriage.\n2. Inbreeding can have a significant impact on the offspring’s IQ, as it can lead to a higher risk of genetic disorders and health problems.\n3. The science behind it is that when two individuals who are closely related mate, they are more likely to share the same genetic mutations. These mutations can be harmful to the offspring and can lead to a lower IQ.\n4. For example, if two individuals who are related share a genetic mutation that affects the development of the brain, the offspring may have a lower IQ than average.\n5. Additionally, inbreeding can also lead to a higher risk of genetic disorders and health problems, such as birth defects, mental illness, and physical disabilities.\n6. These disorders and health problems can also affect the offspring’s IQ.\n7. It is important to note that not all inbreeding leads to lower IQ, and the impact on IQ can vary depending on the degree of relatedness between the individuals.\n8. However, inbreeding is generally not recommended as it can lead to a higher risk of genetic disorders and health problems, and can have a negative impact on the offspring’s IQ.\nPrevious: What is the most common cause of death among children?\nNext: What is the most common cause of death among children?",
    "Answer": "take it that a human body has 2 sets of genes. When a baby is made, half the genes are from the mother and other half is from the father. These genes make proteins which help our body work. However, there are occasionally some errors in the genes which ends up making defective/too much/too little proteins which give rise to diseases.  Some of these diseases require 2 faulty set of genes in order to manifest. So if daddy has a defective gene but mommy contributes a normal set, the disease does not manifest clinically (or is milder). If there are many generations of inbreeding, the set of defective genes are kept within the same family tree; there is no new genetic input from a different family and thus the probability of having a child with 2 sets of defective genes increase. This increases the risk of diseases, out of which some may feature a lower IQ/brain malformations.",

    "Answer": "A) You need a large array of solar powers to provide full coverage to the home (large initial cost, requires a lot of surface area, potentially takes away from the visual appeal of the home) B) until very recently, there hasn't really been any cost-effective battery solution for homes (Tesla Powerwall is helping to change this) C) Most people who live in developed countries don't have to worry about power outages because they are extremely rare. In these countries, it doesn't make sense to install solar panels just as an emergency backup... you would only do the install if your intention was to go off-grid so you don't have to pay a monthly electric utility bill (and/or because you can sell excess electricity back to the grid / power company to potentially earn money).",

    "Answer": "Because that's the top speed you can safely do, assuming ideal conditions (at least that's the premise). When it's raining, snowing, cold or dark, this changes it from being ideal conditions. It's not safe to drive at that speed any more. Worse it is, the slower you need to go, especially if your visibility is impaired. Too much variation in the weather to set a \"minimum speed\". Not sure about you are, but here there is a 5% tolerance on our 100kph speed limit - 105 before they'll ping you. (which quite funnily is, in mph, equating to 63mph in a 60)",

I also believe the rights of refusal which is a teams ability to choose three of the teams free agents and match any offer given to them. So for example, if Chad Ochocinco was a restricted free agent looking for a team, and the New England Patriots agreed with Chad that they'd pay him 30 million for 2 years, the Bengals could match the pay and keep Chad despite him wanting to play for the Patriots.  Other outcomes include each team's salary cap for their players being 120 million. (the number might be wrong but that is one gist).  There are many more but those are the main ones I know of.",

In one universe, the coin comes up heads. In another universe it comes up tails. Now say you decide to kill yourself. You get a gun and point it at your head and pull the trigger. In one universe, it goes off and you die. In another, the gun jams and you live. Since the only universe you are alive in is the one where you live, you experience that universe.

    "Answer": "I don't know for certain, but think about it: Plants are sedentary. They find a particular kind of environment that suits them well and, for the most part, stay in one place for their whole lives. They don't need to develop systems that allow for locomotion. They don't need to develop complex tissues and organs that make up that system, nor the vessels and oxygen transport mechanism to ensure the cells in the locomotion system stay energized. They don't require much energy since, again, they stay put; they make their own energy, and it's enough to get by on.  Much of the complexity of animal life revolves around how they tweak the basic mechanics of moving around. Where does it move? How does it move? What does it require in order to move? How much and what kind of energy does it need? Does it regulate its own internal temperature?",

    "Answer": "Student Civil Engineer here. To put it as if you are actually 5. Imagine there is a road, now underneath that road there is soil. Over time water can erode (takes away) bits of soil. Over a period of time there is now no more soil under the road since the water has eroded it and there is just a big hole. Eventually the road cannot support its own weight and collapses into the empty space. This is a sinkhole. The reason why i said over time and over a period of time is because these can happen fast (during floods) or very slowly. A leak in a sewage pipe over years dropping small amounts of water every few minutes can still create a sinkhole. Hope this is helpful.",

    "Answer": "No. Ads are usually provided by a 3rd party company from their servers, not the same server that is delivering the rest of the content on the page, so they can often take longer to load compared to other stuff on the page.  They are often also image-heavy, which means they take longer to load than text. They are also usually inserted into the page using javascript, so that they can load several different ads to different viewers on the same page, or target ads to different users, or track impressions, & c. The script that loads these ads often runs after other content in the page has loaded, so that the page doesn't have to wait on the ads & just display as blank while the ads load (this would lose you a ton of visitors, & make the ads worthless because there'd be no visitors to see them once they do load).",

We are not recycling aluminium as much as we are producing it.",
    "Answer": "Yes, it would be, but then there would also be a finite amount of aluminum on earth and we would never be able to have more bottles and cans than we do right now. The world is growing and we still have a need for new aluminum. People like airplane manufacturers and NASA need lots of high quality aluminum so they are willing to pay for the good stuff, coke doesn't need anyhting other than tin cans so they likely wont pay a premium for new aluminum and jsut use the recycled stuff.",

    "Answer": "Each awards show has their own thing. You're probably aware of the Oscars and the Emmy, but there are like a hundred others with their own style and categories.  However you're not alone in your thinking. Not having a separate comedy category has been a regular criticism of the Oscars. They tried to assuage this a bit (and add some flair and promo to the show) by upping the best picture category from 5 films to up to 10, hopefully to allow more diverse films outside of dramas (such as animated, comedy's, and sci-fi films), but this is still pretty new. They changed the voting on it a bit too, but its unknown if this had any effect on the eventual winners. In other words... this particular award show does its own thing, just like the others, and this does not seem like something they are particularly interested in.",

    "Answer": "Next time you go there, look for a sign. There will be one saying \"For Tobacco Use Only\" While bongs are commonly associated with marijuana, they are also used for tobacco and in that regard are perfectly legal. By saying they're only for tobacco it protects the stores from the drug laws you mention. So in order for there to be any legal consequences, people would have to prove that the shop is knowingly selling them for use with marijuana and not tobacco. This is impossible to prove in almost every case.",

    "Answer": "While all buildings are a little different, most use a single boiler and a recirculating hot water system. Hot water circulates in big loops on each floor, driven by small magnetic pumps. This means the water is \"instant-on\". The storage tank is kept warm by the boiler and inflowing water is warmed before it goes into the tank. This provides constant temperature hot water all day.",

    "Answer": "For the same reason Youtube is allowed to exist. The law determined that these sites cannot reasonably be expected to control uploaded content to such a degree, in other words they cannot be held accountable for copyright infringement *as long as* they comply with DMCA requests and delete videos on demand. This does happen even now, I remember a certain popular account on xvideos/xhamster that got banned multiple times for example. The problem of course is that videos get uploaded faster than they can be taken down. Commercial porn sites probably have given up on that battle more or less and adapted. Instead, they release \"sample clips\" in order to advertise for their sites of full HD content. Those commonly 5-minute long vids are just small parts of hour long productions that you usually *don't* get to see.",

    "Answer": "It varies from state to state. One reason could be that you didn't earn enough in at least one of two consecutive quarters. Depending on exactly when your season ends, that could screw you. Or just simply not enough hours.  No matter what the reason, I think you're entitled to a hearing. I'm sure that varies as well, but it's worth looking in to. EDIT: To clarify, I believe this hearing is like an appeal. If you've applied and been denied, it's an opportunity to meet with whomever it would be and plead your case.",

    "Answer": "Because animals don't have language. They communicate emotions with sound like angry growls, panicked screams, horny rumbles, and affectionate purrs, but they can't communicate abstract thoughts, form sentences, assign arbitrary names to objects and events, combine terms to make new concepts, etc, which is what we consider language to be. A Mandarin-speaker and a Finnish-speaker can communicate anger and fear and happiness and affection perfectly well without using language, right? Just by sounds, tones, movements, facial expressions? Well, that's the level on which animals communicate.",

    "Answer": "Nope, because of the magic of asymmetric cryptography. The short version is that the key used to *encrypt* the data is not the same as the one to *decrypt* it. When Alice sends something to Bob, she encrypts it with his *public* key. This is a key that everyone has the right to see and access. Only Bob, who has the only copy of his *private* key, can then decrypt the message. He then sends a reply, encrypting with Alice's public key, and she decrypts with her private key. The same sort of thing happens with an SSL transaction (HTTPS). When you connect to a secure site, you know you have the right site because they have a certificate proving they are who they say they are. That certificate is also the public key, so you send the data encrypted with that key, and only that site can decrypt it. The site sets up a special session key to encrypt the rest of the data, so you and the site can continue to talk encrypted without anybody else being able to view the contents of the traffic.",

    "Answer": "At a basic level you can think of temperature as the average molecular energy of a system. Temperature can be measured in different ways, but they all come down to measuring changes in heat energy (molecular motion and jiggling).  In everyday thermometers, what is measured is how a liquid (originally mercury) expands with temperature, travelling up the bulb. The expansion is due to the atoms in the liquid moving faster and pushing on each other harder.  In devices called thermocouples, the temperature affects how well a piece of metal conducts electricity, which can be measured precisely.  There are also infrared thermometers, which measure the heat energy in the form of light that objects give off. It's important to note that temperature isn't the same thing as energy, but the explanation requires delving into the wonders of thermodynamics, which is a bit too complicated for me to ELI5.",

    "output": "1. Brass is a mixture of copper and zinc. The oligodynamic effect is a phenomenon in which the metal ion of copper or zinc kills bacteria by oxidizing the cell membrane of the bacteria. This phenomenon can be observed in brass doorknobs, which are made of a copper-zinc alloy.\nThe oligodynamic effect is a chemical reaction that occurs when certain metals, such as copper and zinc, come into contact with bacteria. The metal ions oxidize the cell membrane of the bacteria, which causes the membrane to break down and the bacteria to die. This reaction is known as the oligodynamic effect.\nThe oligodynamic effect can be observed in brass doorknobs, which are made of a copper-zinc alloy. When a person touches a brass doorknob, the metal ions in the brass react with the bacteria on the person’s skin, causing the bacteria to die. This process can take anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours, depending on the amount of bacteria present and the concentration of the metal ions in the brass.\nThe oligodynamic effect is a natural and effective way to disinfect surfaces, and it is particularly useful in areas where bacteria are present, such as hospitals and other healthcare facilities. Brass doorknobs are just one example of how the oligodynamic effect can be used to disinfect surfaces.\nAnswer: 2.

The distance to the objects in the scene is unchanged (maybe a little longer by the distance to the mirror and back).",

To get more complex, this hair is unaffected by DHT which causes MPB hair loss.

    "Answer": "It's depends on how air tight the room is. You will notice this with doors that are tighter to the carpet and not under cut. Take a door that you can't slam because of this and open a window in that room the air will be forced out the window and the door will close easier. Opening or closing a door rapidly will generate lots of air movement. Without somewhere to go it will be more difficult to close. Undercut doors allow air underneath. Similar to Windows letting air outside.

    "Answer": "There essentially isn't one. Within an individual product line from a given manufacturer the numbers may mean something, but mostly they are just the name the manufacturer gave to that video card. It's all about marketing. The first number in most cards indicates the \"generation\" of video card they belong to, but this is still just marketing. A higher number doesn't necessarily mean more performance. A high-end GTX 6xx card might outperform a low-end GTX 7xx card, for instance. Basically, you have to look at the charts. The numbers are made up to sell more video cards, not to be informative in any way.",

    "prompt": "Question: What does \"single payer\" mean in the american health care system ?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. The term \"single payer\" is used to describe a health care system in which a single entity (usually a government) is responsible for paying for all medical care. In the United States, the most common form of single payer is Medicare, which is a federal program that provides health insurance to people over the age of 65 and to certain disabled individuals.\n2. The advantages of a single payer system include:\na) Reduced administrative costs: A single payer system eliminates the need for multiple insurance companies, which can reduce administrative costs and simplify the billing process.\nb) Greater efficiency: A single payer system can negotiate lower prices with providers and pharmaceutical companies, which can lead to lower costs for patients.\nc) Equal access: A single payer system ensures that everyone has access to health care, regardless of income or employment status.\nd) Reduced paperwork: A single payer system can simplify the process of filing claims and processing payments, which can reduce the amount of paperwork involved in health care.\n3. The disadvantages of a single payer system include:\na) Reduced choice: A single payer system may limit the number of providers and hospitals that are available to patients, which can reduce the choice of health care providers.\nb) Limited coverage: A single payer system may not cover all types of medical care, which can limit the options available to patients.\nc) Increased taxes: A single payer system may require an increase in taxes to fund the program, which can be a disadvantage for some individuals.\n4. The American health care system is a complex and multi-faceted system that includes a variety of different components, including private insurance, public insurance, and out-of-pocket payments. The United States does not have a single payer system, but rather a mix of public and private insurance options.\n5. In conclusion, the term \"single payer\" refers to a health care system in which a single entity (usually a government) is responsible for paying for all medical care. The advantages of a single payer system include reduced administrative costs, greater efficiency, equal access, and reduced paperwork. The disadvantages of a single payer system include reduced choice, limited coverage, and increased taxes.

    "Answer": "\"Single Payer\" means that there is a single entity that handles all of the insurance payments to medical providers. In this case, that payer would be the government. Instead of multiple private insurers that each cover a small portion of the population and each negotiate their own prices for procedures... we would have one big insurer that covers everyone and negotiates in behalf of everyone for lower prices on procedures. This would allow for lower and more fair pricing as well as universal coverage regardless of wealth or pre-existing conditions.",

The researchers figure out the exact formula they want for a product, it gets scaled up once for the pilot plant so they can figure out how to mass produce it and get the engineering kinks worked out and then it goes to full scale production. At the plant, they have filtered water that mixes with either a concentrated syrup or powder and then its pumped into cans or bottles. Then CO2 can be added and it is sealed and labeled.",

    "Answer": "Salt water pools still use chlorine, the difference is that the chlorine is produced through electrolysis using the salt as the base material. The advantage is that the salt electrolysis process creates free chlorine ions (the type of chlorine that kills bacteria) and burns off chloramines (the type of chlorine that burns your eyes and smells like strong bleach). As long as they are maintained they will work just as well at killing bacteria, and people tend to find them less irritating, especially if they have sensitive skin. The salt system also has the benefit of \"softening\" the water. They tend to have a higher initial setup cost though, and saltwater is more corrosive than freshwater so you have to keep an eye on the internals and plumbing of the filtration system.",

    "Answer": "A driver's license is a state-issued document accepted by state governments certifying your identity and ability to drive.  A passport is a federally-issued document accepted by international governments certifying your identity and travel eligibility and history.  Whereas you can get away with a temporary driver's license printed on a DMV receipt printer, a passport has a LOT of liability tied to it and basically is your country insuring you as \"This person is a Normal Person\"  The cost comes from the legal backing, as well as whatever background checks they need to run on you",

    "Answer": "Quite often, its not. Many times you can combine a rebate with incentivised financing and end up much cheaper than your bank. For example, my wifes 2012 altima is currently financed at 0.5 percent and we bought it several thousand below invoice due to rebates/dealer incentives. No banks/credit unions were anywhere close at the time. The cheapest was around 4% at the time. Where dealerships get you is with all of the add-ons like extended warranties, window etching, undercoats, etc and you will get offered those regardless of whose financing you use.",

    "Answer": "> Why do aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights? Aircraft commonly land at night when it is dark. Being able to see the ground when coming in for a landing is important because they need to touch down at a reasonable speed.

    "prompt": "Question: Why do trained muscles get more volume rather than density?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. Muscles are made up of two different types of cells, slow twitch (type 1) and fast twitch (type 2) muscle fibres. Both types are activated during exercise, but the fast twitch fibres are recruited later and are more active during anaerobic exercise.\n2. The increase in volume of muscles is due to an increase in the number of fast twitch muscle fibres, which are larger than the slow twitch fibres. The fast twitch fibres have a higher density of mitochondria and other cellular components, which allows them to generate more force and power.\n3. The increase in the number of fast twitch muscle fibres is due to the body’s response to training, which involves the recruitment of more fast twitch muscle fibres to meet the demands of the exercise. This is achieved by the body’s adaptation to the increased workload, which includes the growth and proliferation of new muscle fibres.\n4. The increase in the number of fast twitch muscle fibres is also due to the body’s ability to increase the size of the muscle fibres, which is achieved through the production of new protein and the growth of the existing muscle fibres. This is achieved through the body’s response to the increased workload, which includes the stimulation of protein synthesis and the activation of muscle satellite cells.\n5. The increase in the number of fast twitch muscle fibres is also due to the body’s ability to increase the size of the muscle fibres, which is achieved through the production of new protein and the growth of the existing muscle fibres. This is achieved through the body’s response to the increased workload, which includes the stimulation of protein synthesis and the activation of muscle satellite cells.\n6.

Commonly they are uncontacted because they want to be: being contacted tends to screw them over. (They flee from contact, or hear rumors from neighboring contacted tribes.) Either they have few useful skills and end up in the bottom of the heap of capitalism, or they get massacred by brutal 3rd-world mining and logging companies.

    "Answer": "The premise of your question is basically flawed. We can't eat almost anything. About half of the red berries in existence are poisonous to us but not to birds, for example. The same is true about mushrooms. Also, not everything that is edible is food. Uncooked grains are edible, but you would eventually die if that's all you ate.

    "Answer": "They're modular and self-assembling. The first structural piece under the rotation head, the lifter module, is more complex than the rest; it includes slides and jacks. The complete assembly process involves anchoring the base and setting up the horizontal arm. Once that's ready, the lifter module jacks up the head and the arm, and the crane lifts a structural segment off a truck and into place. Once the new segment is bolted in, the jacks retract and are bolted onto the new top structural segment. This process is repeated until the crane is as tall as it needs to be. Disassembly is the same process in reverse, with a caveat. If there is more than one crane involved, they may build around a crane within the building, so long as at least one crane is outside to lift out the pieces. The last crane, however, always has to have enough clear space to disassemble itself in the same process in reverse that it assembled itself with.",

    "Answer": "That's not really how treaties work. Treaties aren't like \"you get to keep all the land you've taken,\" they always specify very exact borders.

Of course, they could just break the treaty. There weren't any real international institutions in place to enforce that sort of thing, but you don't really make any friends with a reputation for breaking promises.",

    "Answer": "We actually don't use mercury anymore, we use alcohol. But the simple answer is because as a liquid metal it is conductive, and expands and contracts predictably (importantly, linearly) with temperature changes. Further, unlike water, it's freezing point is low enough there is little change of that happening, and even if it somehow occurred it wouldn't make the thermometer explode as water would.",

    "Answer": "The rocket engines push against the exhaust that is being expelled. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. It's exactly the same as if you were wearing ice skates (standing on ice, obviously) and holding a bowling ball. If you throw the ball forward, you'll slide backwards. This is not because the bowling ball is pushing against the air. It's because when you push the bowling ball forward, you're also pushing yourself backward.

It's only the only province where French speaking people are a majority.  > How come since Quebec was British owned and subsequently part of an independant Canada, English was not able to replace French? To avoid uprisings, the British accepted that it would keep its laws, language and religion thinking they would eventually assimilate. People decided they wouldn't and made efforts to preserve those. To this day, Quebec still works on a different legal system than the other provinces.  > Is French still realy the dominant language of Quebec? Yes.  > Do most people speak it there? Yes  > What are the languages though in school/shown on tv/ radio etc.? School teaches some English but not enough to qualify as bilingual. Media produced in Quebec are in French.",

    "Answer": "It's probably a combination of reasons. Humans like to be awake all day and sleep all night. And we take our cues from the sun. If it's raining it's darker, so our bodies think, hey almost time for bed! Let's get sleepy! The other reason is ( I'm not to sure about this one so other redditors feel free to debunk me! ): When we're in our mommy's belly we're constantly surrounded by the sound of her body, her digestive system gurgling but mostly the sound of her blood circulating. Which is a constant rushing sound. Rain kinda sounds like that, just like a rolling car, or vacuum cleaner. This makes us feel safe and comfortable. And again sleepy. Fun facts about this: If you drive a long way and don't have any distracting sounds like a radio the sound of your car can cause 'highway hypnosis' causing you to relax and fall asleep behind the wheel. Babies, when they're tired fall alseep very easily in the car or when a vacuum cleaner is running. Because it reminds them of being inside mommy's belly.",

    "output": "1) Smoking preserves food by destroying microorganisms that are responsible for the spoilage of food.\n2) Smoking food involves exposing food to smoke from burning wood or other materials.\n3) This smoke contains chemicals that kill bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that can cause food to spoil.\n4) Smoke also contains nitrogen compounds that help preserve food by inhibiting the growth of bacteria.\n5) Smoking food also helps to dry out the food, which can make it more resistant to spoilage.\n6) This process can help to extend the shelf life of food and prevent it from going bad.\n7) However, smoked food can also contain high levels of salt and nitrates, which can be harmful to health if consumed in large quantities.",
    "Answer": "Smoking by itself is actually insufficient to properly preserve foods. Smoke is an antimicrobial and an antioxidant but only protects the outside of food, so it is usually combined with other processes like salt-curing and drying which protect the interior of food from bacterial growth.",

    "Answer": "This is due to how the movement is processed in the brain. Very basically, there are certain neurons that are firing in response to the moving pattern. The moving pattern is constant, so they are firing continuously. When you look away those same cells continue to fire because they've been doing so for however long you were looking at it. Your brain knows that the moving pattern is no longer in focus, but it still takes a bit to inhibit the neurons and stop them from firing. It's why optical illusions [like this one](_URL_1_) work.",

    "output": "1. CERN is a European Organization for Nuclear Research. It is a research institute that conducts research in the fields of particle physics, nuclear physics, and theoretical physics.\n2. CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a particle accelerator that is used to collide particles at high energies, in order to study the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern them. The LHC is the largest and most powerful particle accelerator in the world, and it is capable of accelerating particles to energies of up to 13 trillion electronvolts (TeV).\n3. The LHC is designed to study the properties of the Higgs boson, a particle that is believed to be responsible for giving other particles their mass. The Higgs boson was first predicted by Peter Higgs and others in the 1960s, and its existence was confirmed by the LHC in 2012.\n4. The LHC has also been used to search for new particles and forces that are not predicted by the Standard Model of particle physics. For example, it has been used to search for evidence of supersymmetry, a theory that proposes the existence of new particles that are related to the known particles of the Standard Model.\n5. CERN's research has led to a number of important discoveries in the field of particle physics, and it has also contributed to the development of new technologies and applications, such as the World Wide Web, which was developed by CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee in the 1980s.\n6. CERN's research has also led to the development of new technologies and applications, such as the World Wide Web, which was developed by CERN physicist Tim Berners-Lee in the 1980s.\n7. However, the LHC has also been criticized for its potential risks. Some people have expressed concerns that the high-energy collisions that take place in the LHC could create new particles or forces that could be dangerous to the Earth or the universe. However, the LHC is designed to be safe, and the risks associated with its operations are considered to be very low.\n8. The LHC is also controversial because of its high cost. The construction of the LHC has cost billions of dollars, and some people have criticized the project for its high cost and the limited benefits it has provided.\n9. Overall, CERN's research has led to a number of important discoveries in the field of particle physics, and it has also contributed to the development of new technologies and applications. However, the LHC has also been criticized for its potential risks and high cost.\n10. CERN's research is important because it helps to advance our understanding of the fundamental building blocks of matter and the forces that govern them. The LHC is a powerful tool for studying these particles and forces, and it has already led to a number of important discoveries.\n11. The LHC is also important because it is helping to push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe. It is allowing us to explore regions of the universe that were previously inaccessible, and it is providing new insights into the nature of matter and energy.\n12. Overall, CERN's research is important because it is helping to advance our understanding of the universe and the fundamental laws of nature. It is also important because it is helping to push the boundaries of our knowledge and to explore new frontiers of science.",
    "Answer": "CERN is basically trying to find out the origins of our universe and how everything works by using a very large particle accelerator to accelerate particles to 99.99991% the speed of light and have them collide with one another. When these particles collide they break apart and that is when we can see what holds particles together and how things work. Only problem is that there is years of data to go through and experimentally proving everything will take a long time.  There is no real threat from this, what you see online is just that, \"conspiracy theories.\" People believing that smashing particles will create a black hole and destroy the world.",

    "Answer": "It's largely a US thing, and only in some states which consider mortgages to be a \"non-recourse debt\". The debt is secured on the property, but the borrower isn't personally liable for the debt beyond that security. If foreclosing and selling the property doesn't cover the full debt then the lender can't pursue the borrower further.",

    "output": "1) Why do different cheeses made from the same type of milk have different Calcium values?\nThe calcium content of cheese depends on the type of milk used for its production, the age of the cheese, and the type of cheese.\nThe type of milk used for cheese production can affect the calcium content of the cheese. For example, milk from cows that are fed a diet rich in calcium-rich feed, such as alfalfa, will have a higher calcium content than milk from cows that are fed a diet that is not rich in calcium.\nThe age of the cheese can also affect its calcium content. As the cheese ages, the calcium content decreases. This is because the calcium is slowly leached out of the cheese as it ages.\nThe type of cheese can also affect its calcium content. For example, hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, have a higher calcium content than soft cheeses, such as Brie. This is because the calcium is concentrated in the whey during the cheese-making process.\n2) Explain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nThe calcium content of cheese depends on the type of milk used for its production, the age of the cheese, and the type of cheese. The calcium content of milk is determined by the diet of the cow that produces the milk. Cows that are fed a diet rich in calcium-rich feed, such as alfalfa, will have a higher calcium content in their milk than cows that are fed a diet that is not rich in calcium. The calcium content of milk also depends on the age of the cow. Younger cows tend to have higher calcium content in their milk than older cows.\nThe calcium content of cheese is also affected by the cheese-making process. During the cheese-making process, the milk is curdled and the whey is separated from the curds. The calcium is concentrated in the whey, and the curds are used to make cheese. The amount of calcium that is concentrated in the whey depends on the type of cheese being made. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, have a higher calcium content than soft cheeses, such as Brie. This is because the calcium is concentrated in the whey during the cheese-making process.\nThe calcium content of cheese also depends on the age of the cheese. As the cheese ages, the calcium content decreases. This is because the calcium is slowly leached out of the cheese as it ages. The rate at which the calcium is leached out of the cheese depends on the type of cheese. Hard cheeses, such as Parmesan, have a higher calcium content than soft cheeses, such as Brie. This is because the calcium is concentrated in the whey during the cheese-making process.\nThe calcium content of cheese can also be affected by the environment in which the cheese is stored. For example, cheese that is stored in a humid environment will have a higher calcium content than cheese that is stored in a dry environment. This is because the calcium is more likely to be leached out of the cheese in a humid environment.\nIn conclusion, the calcium content of cheese depends on the type of milk used for its production, the age of the cheese, and the type of cheese. The calcium content of milk is determined by the diet of the cow that produces the milk. Cows that are fed a diet rich in calcium-rich feed, such as alfalfa, will have a higher calcium content in their milk than cows that are fed a diet that is not rich in calcium. The calcium content of milk also depends on the age of the cow. Younger cows tend to have higher calcium content in their milk than older cows. The calcium content of cheese is also affected by the cheese-making process. During the cheese-making process, the milk is curdled and the whey is separated from the curds.

    "Answer": "It basically comes down to pH value of the whey and it's drained. Casein is bonded by calcium phosphate (which is where the calcium comes from) and as the pH decreases it becomes soluble and is drained away.",

When Ford was paying workers $2 per day (maybe $2.50, not sure), the going rate at the time, there was lots of turnover and constant hiring and training, so Ford decided to double the rate to $5 per day to reduce turnover and keep employees instead of constantly training new hires. At the same time, he also decided to make a five day work week to give his employees Saturday off, thinking they would buy more cars to ride around in for the weekend. The local business community told him he would bankrupt his business. The day after he ran a full page ad in the paper for the $5 per day jobs, there were massive lines of people applying for jobs with Ford. The idea was extremely successful, and the weekend was born.",

    "output": "1. I think there is so much apparent public criticism against labor unions when they empower mostly low to middle income workers because of the following reasons.\n2. Firstly, labor unions are considered as a source of political power by the political elite. The political elite is the class of people who are in power and have the ability to influence the political process. They are often associated with the ruling class or the wealthy elite. The political elite is not necessarily a homogeneous group, and it can include different political parties, politicians, businessmen, and other influential individuals.\n3. Labor unions have the power to mobilize large numbers of workers and can use this power to influence the political process. This can be done through strikes, protests, and other forms of collective action. The political elite may see labor unions as a threat to their power and may therefore seek to undermine or weaken them.\n4. Secondly, labor unions are often associated with socialist or communist ideologies, which are generally opposed by the political elite. The political elite may see labor unions as a threat to their political and economic interests and may therefore seek to undermine or weaken them.\n5. Thirdly, labor unions are often associated with the working class, which is generally considered to be a source of social unrest and instability. The political elite may see labor unions as a source of social unrest and may therefore seek to undermine or weaken them.\n6. Fourthly, labor unions are often associated with higher wages and better working conditions for workers. This can be seen as a threat to the political elite, as it can lead to increased costs for businesses and a decrease in profits.\n7. Fifthly, labor unions are often associated with the redistribution of wealth and resources, which can be seen as a threat to the political elite. The political elite may see labor unions as a threat to their power and may therefore seek to undermine or weaken them.\n8. Sixthly, labor unions are often associated with the redistribution of power, which can be seen as a threat to the political elite.

The real opposition to Obamacare is not over its actual impact on the economy or personal freedom, it is about squashing any impulse towards collectivism or solidarity and replacing it with self-defeating individualism. \"Organized capital and vertical monopoly GOOD and organized labor BAD.\" Progressive movements are floundering in iterative intersectionality and back-biting while capital prospers unopposed.",

    "Answer": "The way we find these planets is to monitor the amount of light coming from a star and then see if it drops slightly occasionally. If it does then that means the star is partially obscured by a planet transiting across the front of it.  We do not have that perspective on planets beyond the orbit of earth as there is nothing bright for them to obscure. We cannot see them with telescopes because they are too dark and/or distant to detect, the best we can do is look for slight changes in the orbit of objects we can see (such as Pluto) to see if they are being affected by the gravity of something unknown.",

    "Answer": "The correct answer is that you have the same amount of B in A as there is A in B. Consider this: each container has 100 units of liquids A and B. The ladle can carry 10 units. In the first scoop, you have 10 units of A in the ladle. You transferred it to container B. Now Container A has 90 units of A. Container B has 100 units of B and 10 units of A. When you take a scoop from container B, you have about 0.91 units of A, and 9.09 units of B (since that solution is 10/110 liquid A). You add this to container A. Now container A has 90.91 units of liquid A, and 9.09 units of B. However, container B still has the same proportion of liquid A and B after the first mixing - namely, 10/110 liquid A, and 100/110 liquid B. This translates to 9.09 units of liquid A, and 90.9 units of liquid B.",

    "Answer": "Your repertoire is the body of works that you have learnt and are able to perform. You may have one or many pieces in your repertoire.  In this context, it sounds like you are being asked for pieces of contrasting style, or from different periods in the history of classical music. If you fulfill the latter, then you pretty much automatically fulfill the first - for instance you could have four sonatas from the Classical period, and you would have to strive hard to make sure they all offered contrasting elements. Or you could choose four different sorts of pieces from the Classical period and show the variety that was present in just one period. Or (and this seems like the safest bet), you could choose four pieces from different periods and they would almost certainly provide plenty of contrast. I'm thinking in terms of Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, 20th Century, and Contemporary/Modern periods. There is no end to the variety of different styles and types of work since the 20th Century.",

In big bags of chips, the manufacturer can jiggle the serving size so that each serving will have less than 0.5 g. But small bags of chips are generally considered to contain only 1 serving, and so they can't divide out extra servings to screw with the numbers.",

    "prompt": "Question: How does electrical grounding work for ships? Why is it so complicated?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. A grounding system is a collection of conductors that connects a ship's metal hull to the sea, thereby reducing the chance of electrical shock to people and damage to sensitive electronic equipment.\n2. The ship's hull is typically made of metal, which is a good conductor of electricity. If the ship is in contact with the sea, the water acts as a conductor of electricity as well. If the ship is grounded, the electricity will flow through the metal hull and into the sea, rather than through the people or electronic equipment on the ship.\n3. The complexity of the grounding system depends on the size and type of ship. For example, a small boat may only require a simple grounding system, while a large ship may require a more complex system with multiple grounding points.\n4. The grounding system must be properly designed and installed to ensure that it is effective and safe. This may involve using specialized equipment, such as grounding clamps or grounding cables, and following specific safety procedures.\n5. Grounding systems are also used in other industries, such as in electrical power plants and telecommunications towers, to reduce the risk of electrical shock and damage to equipment.\n6. The grounding system is a critical component of the ship's electrical system and must be properly maintained and inspected to ensure that it is functioning properly.",

The war in Iraq was still going on, and many people were losing their lives.

    "Answer": "Probably because with each year that goes by, you have a longer frame of reference to what time feels like? I don't think I phrased that well, but what I mean is that if you are 5, one year is 20% of your entire existence. If you are 50, one year is 2% of your life. So, to get the same feeling of \"long ago\", it takes more years, the older you get. Same concept as why summers seem to fly by compared to when you were a kid.",

    "Answer": "Special relativity describes flat space; general relativity describes curved space. Note that general relativity is a superset of special. It's not an evolutionary step - GR doesn't replace SR like GR replaced Newton. On a scale where the curvature of space is approximately zero, things behave just like SR says.  Note that all other forces and particles inhabit space, so SR is really a statement about the geometry that applies to all forces and particles. Although it was first discovered in the context of electromagnetism, it's not unique to electromagnetism.",

    "Answer": "Inside your eye are 3 different kinds of cells for detecting colors, one can see red, one can see green, and one can see blue. In colorblind individuals, one of those is either missing or not functioning properly, and so the number of combinations of colors you can distinguish is drastically lowered. You can still tell most colors apart because even if you may not see green properly, you'll detect the varying shades of red and blue in that color but you're missing some of the information.",

The rims budge out so they can touch each other. & nbsp; The front wheel can't be doubled because it would interfere with steering. In order to only need one spare tire, the truck using the same wheel across the entire trunk, meaning that the budged rim is used for the front wheels. edit: spelling",

    "Answer": "Wells are not technically built, they are drilled.  In reference to a water well, a company will do some research to see if they can drill a well in the desired area. This all depends on location, ground type, and various other things. If a well is drillable they will bring out a truck, that is basically a small oil derrick, and begin drilling the well. Depending on you location and ground type the depth of the well will vary.  Some places have underground \"rivers\" and can be relatively shallow wells, on the other had, some need to be deeper so that more water will seep into the vacant area that is created by the drilling.  Once the well is drilled you can begin getting water from it using a bucket or a pump.  This is all i know. I hope this answers your question. Resource: had a well drilled on old property.

    "Answer": "Raindrops form when water vapour in the atmosphere clusters around microscopic solid particles (such as dust) in a process called nucleation. Nucleation is reversible. As water molecules attach themselves to cluster, other molecules are leaving. There is a point called the *critical nuclear size*, at which point the cluster of water molecules is stable. This is the point at which a raindrop forms. The critical nuclear size /critical radius is controlled by temperature. The mathematics tells us that as the temperature is lowered, the critical radius decreases. Hopefully this answers your first question, and if I'm wrong I'd very much like to be called out on it! Cunningham's Law and all that ;) Ultimately, though, the answer lies in thermodynamics.",

    "Answer": "Well, they use very rigorous clean room techniques to minimize the amount of biological contamination that is on our probes. Beyond that, the harshness of the environment is likely to whittle down at least some of what small amount they miss. But they are not sure they are not contaminating the objects, they probably miss *some* stuff. Not that either environment is especially conducive to life as we know it. The Moon especially, although some things may be able to eek out at least survival on Mars, if not prosperity. They care because we don't want to substantially alter the environment we are studying before we study it, and just in case there could *be* anything alive there, it'd be a shame to accidentally destroy it with competition. Additionally, if we go to all the work to find life and then bring samples back to Earth, it'd be a real bummer if by the time they got here it as just good ole tardigrades or something of the sort.",

    "Answer": "It is a good question. The answer is how it works on the organism. Anti-biotics work by interfering with some important function of a bacteria cell. Think of throwing a wrench into a machine and watching it gum up the works. Cells that have different machine arrangements can be more resistant to wrenches. They'll have casings around important stuff or gears that can allow a wrench to slip through the teeth without stopping. Maybe they have extra redundant machines.  Alcohol, chlorine and copper work by physically dismantling the machine. No amount of changing the machine will help when you shown up with a screw driver and start removing things.",

Turns out, when the visual centers of the brain begin losing oxygen, you start getting tunnel vision, plus you lose the ability to see color, which means whatever light source you look at starts looking like the \"light as the end of the tunnel\", even if you happen to be staring at a streetlight or something.",

    "Answer": "The more general rule is that a system will tend to minimize its potential energy. For example, a ball on the top of a hill \"wants\" to roll down to minimize its gravitational potential energy. Similarly, a circuit \"wants\" to minimize its electrical potential energy, or voltage (technically voltage is electric potential energy per charge aka electric potential). *Ground* is defined as voltage=0, so a circuit being grounded is like the ball reaching the bottom of the hill.",

    "Answer": "It is calculated by measuring the rates of breakdown under less than ideal storage conditions. With ice cream, the limiting factor is likely to be the time it takes for ice crystals to grow, as well as the oxidation of some fats, degrading the taste and texture of the product. Because of this, it is likely to be called a 'Best Before' than an 'Expiry' date. All of this is very complex, but is reduced to a certain number of days, from which is subtracted a safety margin, again carefully calculated. This is added to the date of production to give an expiry date.  If it has been in your properly functioning freezer, and is a few days over, then chow down and enjoy.",

    "Answer": "Chargers also need to tell the phone - in some way - how much power is available. The 1A wall charger provided with your device has the circuitry there to properly communicate with device. The third-party car charger doesn't, so the device might assume it is an overloaded version 1 USB port, and draw the minimum 1/10th of an amp. An interesting point is the Samsung chargers. Although they will provide 1 amp at 5 volts to anything that plugs into them, plug a Samsung device in and it will negotiate up to 20 volts to charge the device quickly.",

    "Answer": "There is no such concept as \"defensive weapon\" in any of the UK legal systems. Anything carried with the sole or primary intent of causing injury upon another is always considered an offensive weapon in the UK. Note that the perceived intent of usage is important. If you were carrying a baseball bat outside a town park at 11 o'clock on a Sunday morning you'd be highly unlikely to be stopped by the police. If you had the same bat outside the same park at 2am the police would almost certainly consider it an offensive weapon. Also note that defending yourself in a threatening situation is perfectly legal in the UK, as long as you use \"proportional force\" and that you haven't pre-armed yourself with a weapon.",

    "Answer": "Gas prices are largely driven by gas demand. The *demand* for gas however isn't usually driven by prices. That is, most people don't travel less just because gas costs more, they have a set number of miles they *have to* travel to live their lives. Well, if a bunch of people don't have jobs, and don't have any reason to shop, and can't afford to travel, suddenly they use less gas. Gas has to become cheaper to sell all the gas they can make that isn't being used.",

    "output": "1. The trees produce different shapes/sizes of leaves to perform different functions.\n2. The leaves of a tree are the most important organs of the tree as they are the site of photosynthesis.\n3. Photosynthesis is a process by which green plants synthesize food from carbon dioxide and water with the help of sunlight and chlorophyll.\n4. Chlorophyll is a green pigment present in the leaves.\n5. Photosynthesis takes place in the mesophyll cells of the leaf.\n6. The mesophyll cells of the leaves are present between the upper and lower epidermis.\n7. The upper epidermis is covered with a layer of transparent cuticle.\n8. The lower epidermis is covered with a layer of stomata.\n9. The stomata are microscopic pores present on the lower epidermis.\n10. The stomata are necessary for the exchange of gases, i.e., carbon dioxide and oxygen.\n11. The stomata are guarded by specialized cells called guard cells.\n12. The guard cells are bean-shaped and contain chloroplasts.\n13. The guard cells contain chloroplasts because they are involved in photosynthesis.\n14. The stomata are open during the day and closed at night.\n15. The guard cells swell and shrink to open and close the stomata.\n16. The guard cells swell and shrink by the entry and exit of potassium ions.\n17. The potassium ions enter the guard cells through the stomatal pore when the stomata are open.\n18. The potassium ions exit the guard cells through the stomatal pore when the stomata are closed.\n19. The stomata are open during the day because the guard cells swell when potassium ions enter the guard cells.\n20. The stomata are closed at night because the guard cells shrink when potassium ions exit the guard cells.\n21. The stomata are closed at night because the concentration of potassium ions in the guard cells is higher than the concentration of potassium ions in the surrounding cells.\n22. The stomata are open during the day because the concentration of potassium ions in the guard cells is lower than the concentration of potassium ions in the surrounding cells.\n23.

    "Answer": "> many games available on standard cable packages like college? Because they make more money the way it is currently setup. It's pretty simple at that. They have limited games on broadcast TV which they charge crazy rates for, which in turn is a limited amount of games people can watch which means everyone is watching them and the networks can charge crazy rates for ads. The NFL then sells exclusive access to Sunday Ticket to DirecTV for a giant rate (DirecTV paid way too much) to make even more money. The NFL is unarguably the best league in the world of sports at crafting and learning how to extract maximum value from their TV rights. Other leagues like the English Premier League, UEFA, NBA and such are all learning from the NFL's examples on how to craft TV deals, the NFL is just the best at it.",

    "Answer": "If you think animals are not afraid of water you have never tried to bath a horse or take one through a puddle. lol.  Humans know there is a choice, that water can be warm or cold.. or even too hot. Animals know the temperature of the lakes/streams as being what they are.. they don't see any reason to be silly and enter it slowly if they need to cross, but sometimes you will see them entering water slowly when they are not in a hurry. Maybe you need to be around nature more.",

    "Answer": "All are spinning masses of air. Tornadoes are much smaller than the others being only a matter of yards across. A cyclone is air spinning around a low pressure system and can be used regardless of the size. Cyclone is also used for a violent tropical storm, especially one originating in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or Indian Ocean. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same thing. If it's in the Atlantic it's called a hurricane and if it's in the Pacific around south East Asia china and Japan it's called a typhoon.   Hurricane can also be used for any wind with a speed over 73mph.",

    "Answer": "It is sort of complicated. Generally, the person credited as the \"writer\" comes up with the main composition, or chord structure and melody for the song.  For instance- Sting is listed as the sole composer for \"Every Breath You Take\", because he came up with the chord structure- but when you think about that song, it is Andy Summers' guitar riff that probably comes to mind. However- Sting pulls in a reported $2k per day in royalties, while Summers gets squat. The thought being that the other musicians (bass, drums, horns, etc) are merely playing along to the already \"composed\" structure of the song. Yes- they are still \"writing\" their parts- but the structure already existed.",

    "output": "1. Svartifoss is a waterfall located in Vatnajökull National Park in Iceland. It is one of the most popular tourist attractions in the country.\n2. The waterfall is named after the dark basalt columns that form the cliffs around the waterfall. These columns were created by lava flows that cooled and hardened over time.\n3. The cliffs surrounding the waterfall are square-shaped due to the cooling process of the lava flow. As the lava flowed over the ground, it cooled and hardened in layers.

In conclusion, the cliffs surrounding the svartifoss waterfall are square-shaped due to the cooling process of the lava flow that created them. The unique shape of the cliffs makes the waterfall a popular tourist destination and a source of inspiration for many artists.\nAnswer: The cliffs surrounding the Svartifoss waterfall are square-shaped because the basalt columns that form the cliffs were created by lava flows that cooled and hardened over time.\nWhen lava flows, it can cool and harden quickly or slowly depending on the temperature and composition of the lava. If the lava cools quickly, it forms a columnar jointing pattern, where the lava cools in a series of columns that are perpendicular to the direction of the flow. This creates a square-shaped pattern in the cliffs.\nThe Svartifoss waterfall is located in the Vatnajökull National Park in Iceland, which is home to many other unique geological features. The basalt columns that form the cliffs around the waterfall were formed by a lava flow that cooled and hardened over time, creating a unique and beautiful landscape.\nThe Svartifoss waterfall is a popular tourist destination, and visitors can hike to the top of the cliffs for a better view of the waterfall.

Many New World crops offered vastly superior yields and nutritional value -- the introduction of potatoes to northern Europe caused an increase in available food which was followed by an increase in population which in turn necessitated the growing of more and more potatoes to feed the area's population.

And some fabric may allow the foot to \"breathe\" a hair better. But in the end, it's clever marketing.",

    "Answer": "Properly securing websites is one of those things where if you're doing your job right, no one notices. If you're doing it wrong, no one notices until you get compromised. This is why it often doesn't get enough attention. In addition, because various sites are architected in many different ways in terms of software and topology, there's no one \"right way\" to secure things. Whereas there exist best practices for Wordpress blogs for example, time must be spent to determine where more complex systems are vulnerable. That doesn't excuse basic mistakes like not salting passwords or leaving database ports open, however. Some of the recent attacks are not technological, but rather are social engineering. If users are giving away their credentials, there's no foolproof solution.",

    "Answer": "This is obviously a very complicated question, ~~Nobel Prize winning~~ economist Thomas Piketty set out to explore it in his book Capital. What it comes down to is this: If you make enough money (and only enough) to keep you alive, you will never get any richer. Every day you will earn $5 and at the end of the day you will have $0 left, and so the cycle repeats until you die. But if you earn $6, you can put away some of that money. You can save $1 a day and put it in a bank account. You can set the money to work, *to make you more money*. For the super-rich, this is even more extreme. The more money you make, the more you can invest, and the more you make off of those investments that you can then re-invest. It's a positive feedback loop.",

    "Answer": "The vocal folds (also known as your vocal cords) are mucous membranes. Unlike muscles, which can atrophy and deteriorate from lack of use, using or not using the vocal cords doesn't really make a huge difference in their well-being. You might have some voice breaking or stammering when you try to speak again after a long time, but it's not like they would waste away from lack of use.  I believe that the biggest impact from lack of speaking would be more psychological. If you're in a situation where you can manage to not speak for any reason, you probably will not have a lot of human contact, which can affect your mental health in various different ways.",

    "Answer": "Simplistically and quite generally, race is what most people think of as one's physical form, and is based on outward appearance. Ethnicity is what most people think of as one's background, and is based on things like language, clothing, religious customs, etc. There are no hard lines between these designations, some overlap, and their definition is also very fluid, depending on the preconceptions and background of the observer themselves.  Generally, when thinking of race, an observer will describe someone as being Black, or Asian, or White. This same observer might describe that persons ethnicity as being Jamaican, Vietnamese, or Polish.  There are all sorts of problems with these kinds of artificial designations, the most important of which is that there really is no such thing as [\"race](_URL_0_)\" *per sé*.",

    "Answer": "60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. Lots of options for splitting time into neat segments. You can divide 60 into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, sixths, tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths. 10 is only divisible by 2 and 5. So you can only divide it neatly into halves and fifths. It's just not as flexible. Edit: I'm a political junkie, so I comment on a lot of threads featuring hot-button issues. But according to my inbox, this is the most incendiary comment I've ever made.",

    "Answer": "The nitrogen gas molecule (N2) is extremely stable and hard to crack apart. Most living organisms can't do it - most of the biological nitrogen in existence came from specialized bacteria. On the other hand, the oxygen gas molecule (O2) is highly reactive, meaning its energy can be harnessed for useful chemical reactions, like those that support life.",

    "output": "1. A police sketch artist can draw people relatively accurately based on descriptions by using the following steps:\n2. The first step is to gather information about the suspect. The police officer will ask the victim or witnesses to describe the suspect's physical appearance, such as height, weight, hair color, and any distinctive features like scars or tattoos.\n3. The police officer will also ask about the suspect's clothing, including any distinctive patterns or colors. This information is used to create a \"composite sketch\" of the suspect.\n4. The next step is to create a \"lineup\" of suspects. The police officer will gather a group of people who resemble the suspect, and the victim or witnesses will be asked to identify the suspect from the lineup.\n5. If the victim or witnesses are unable to identify the suspect from the lineup, the police officer will use the composite sketch to create a more detailed sketch of the suspect.\n6. The police officer will then use the composite sketch and the lineup to create a \"police sketch\" of the suspect. This sketch is more detailed and accurate than the composite sketch.\n7. The police sketch artist will use the police sketch to create a more detailed and accurate drawing of the suspect. The artist will use the information from the composite sketch and lineup to create a more realistic drawing of the suspect's face, hair, and clothing.\n8.

    "Answer": "It's something of an open question whether they are all that accurate. Often they are accurate only in the gross details (hair colour, large nose, etc) and aren't otherwise recognisable.  It's quite rare for a suspect to be identified purely on the basis of an accurate sketch, though.",

    "Answer": "Much of the answer has to do with the length limitations of vinyl 7\" 45 rpm singles, which for many years were the primary means of promoting a single song. You can only fit about 3 minutes of music onto a 45 rpm single. So historically, if you wanted to write a hit pop song, you had to keep it under that length.

    "output": "1. The falling feeling that you get in your stomach when you go down a hill in a car or roller coaster is known as the “G-Forces”.\n2. The G-Forces are caused by the force of gravity pulling on the body as it moves down a hill.\n3. As the body moves down the hill, the force of gravity pulls it towards the ground, causing the body to experience a downward acceleration.\n4. This acceleration causes the body to experience a force on its body, which causes the body to experience a sensation of weightlessness.\n5. This sensation of weightlessness causes the body to experience a feeling of falling, which is why we experience the “G-Forces” when we go down a hill in a car or roller coaster.\nQuestion: What are the 3 types of G-Forces?\nAnswer: The 3 types of G-Forces are:\n1. Centrifugal Force: This is the force that causes an object to move in a circular motion.\n2. Centripetal Force: This is the force that causes an object to move in a straight line.\n3. Gravitational Force: This is the force that causes an object to move towards the center of the Earth.\nQuestion: How do G-Forces work?\nAnswer: G-Forces work by causing an object to experience a force on its body, which causes the object to experience a sensation of weightlessness. This sensation of weightlessness causes the object to experience a feeling of falling, which is why we experience the “G-Forces” when we go down a hill in a car or roller coaster.\nQuestion: What is the difference between G-Forces and centrifugal force?\nAnswer: The difference between G-Forces and centrifugal force is that G-Forces are caused by the force of gravity pulling on the body as it moves down a hill, while centrifugal force is caused by the force of gravity pulling on the body as it moves in a circular motion.\nQuestion: How do G-Forces affect the body?\nAnswer: G-Forces affect the body by causing it to experience a force on its body, which causes the body to experience a sensation of weightlessness. This sensation of weightlessness causes the body to experience a feeling of falling, which is why we experience the “G-Forces” when we go down a hill in a car or roller coaster.\nQuestion: What is the difference between G-Forces and centripetal force?\nAnswer: The difference between G-Forces and centripetal force is that G-Forces are caused by the force of gravity pulling on the body as it moves down a hill, while centripetal force is caused by the force of gravity pulling on the body as it moves in a straight line.\nQuestion: How do G-Forces affect the body in a car or roller coaster?\nAnswer: G-Forces affect the body in a car or roller coaster by causing it to experience a force on its body, which causes the body to experience a sensation of weightlessness.

    "Answer": "Did you ever jump into a cool swimming pool or river or something, and notice after five minutes or so that it's no longer cold? That's because your body 'gets used' to things after a bit.  Your body is used to gravity (and in fact evolved to take advantage of gravity). So you don't even notice that your insides... and the content of your insides, are all under one gee of gravity, because it's always been that way.  But get on that roller coaster (or even a really fast elevator) and you're exposed to sometimes-more, sometimes-less gees of gravity that make your innards heavier or lighter, as well as anything in them.  So you have upward pressure in your belly region and throat and their content when you round the crest of a big hill at speed, and downward pressure when you hit that curve at the bottom. And the best your brain can translate that to is a falling feeling.",

    "Answer": "Almost all natural water contains salts and other minerals including rivers and sweet water lakes just in different levels. Rivers flow constantly so the salt they pick up from the ground does not have time to build up to the point where it tastes salty. But oceans and lakes get all of this salt poured into them by the rivers where it builds up until even we can taste it. Some more info: _URL_0_",

    "output": "1. The answer is that it is not okay to say racist or sexist things about white people or men, regardless of whether it is okay to say racist or sexist things about other races or sexes.\n2. The reason for this is that racism and sexism are both forms of discrimination that are based on prejudice and stereotypes.\n3. When we make generalizations about people based on their race or sex, we are not taking into account the individual experiences and perspectives of those people.\n4. This can lead to harmful and discriminatory behavior, such as exclusion, harassment, and violence.\n5. It is important to recognize that racism and sexism are systemic problems that are deeply embedded in our society and that they affect people of all races and sexes in different ways.\n6. Therefore, it is crucial to work towards creating a more equitable and inclusive society where all people are treated with respect and dignity, regardless of their race or sex.\nThe question is not clear. It asks why it is okay to say racist things about white people and sexist things about men, but not the other way around. However, the question does not specify what the “other way around” is. It could be referring to racist things about non-white people or sexist things about non-men.\nIt is not okay to say racist things about any group of people, regardless of their race.

    "Answer": "If you want the actual explanation for why some people say this, it is the following: People *claim* that it isn't actually racism because racism = prejudice + power. So if you are a historically disadvantaged group (therefore less power), nothing you do can be racist. It can be bigoted, intolerant, or ignorant - but not *racist*.  Does it make much sense? No, I don't think so. If you want equality, practice equality. Pretty simple. But that is how people try to justify it, anyway. You also have a non-trivial amount of people who just hear \"blacks can't be racist\" (or whatever group you want to use) and go around using that to justify obviously racist/sexist actions without understanding the \"justification\" at all.",

    "output": "1. Wireless speakers work by using radio waves to transmit sound from a source to the speaker.\n2. The source, such as a smartphone, tablet, or laptop, sends an audio signal to the speaker via radio waves.\n3. The speaker has a built-in receiver that picks up the signal and converts it into sound.\n4. The receiver then amplifies the sound and sends it to the speaker’s driver, which is responsible for creating the sound.\n5. The driver is made up of a magnet, a coil of wire, and a diaphragm.\n6. The magnet creates a magnetic field, which causes the coil of wire to move.\n7. This movement creates an electrical current, which is then amplified by the amplifier.\n8. The amplified current is sent to the speaker’s driver, which moves the diaphragm and creates the sound.\n9. The speaker’s driver is responsible for creating the sound waves that we hear.\n10. The sound waves are then amplified by the speaker’s amplifier and sent to the listener.\n11. The listener then hears the sound coming from the speaker.\n12. Wireless speakers are a convenient way to listen to music or audio without having to use wires.\n13. They are also more portable than traditional speakers, making them ideal for use in outdoor settings or for travel.\n14.

    "Answer": "Think of Magneto (and Charles Xavier) as ideologies.  X-Men has always been a metaphor for people who are different, marginalized, etc. Thinking back to the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's (when X-Men was created), you had people advocating non-violent protest (Martin Luther King Jr.) and you had people who were, well, not necessarily violent, but definitely more militant (Malcolm X). Both had more or less the same goals, but their methods and messages were different. Charles Xavier is MLK, Magneto is Malcolm X. They did have to write things in to make Magneto be more towards the \"bad\" sides when talking about mutant superiority (which is subjective), which isn't related at all to civil rights, but the Professor and Magneto started at the same point and diverged.",

    "Answer": "An external hard disk is called as such because it utilizes a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). One of these drives has a metal platter with different magnetic sections, called sectors, that are read by a small magnetic sensor called a head on the end of an actuator arm. Many people are now moving over to flash storage, however, which is what a flash drive utilizes and thus is named for. Flash storage does not contain moving parts but rather is similar to a large grid of capacitors and transistors that are used to keep data. It is faster to access than an HDD because you do not need to wait for the disk to spin to the correct location. It can decay, however, unlike an HDD. The more an area of flash is written the more it wears out and eventually it will fail.",

    "output": "1. The quality of education at different institutions varies depending on the resources available to them. For example, a research university like Yale has the resources to invest in the best faculty, facilities, and equipment, which allows them to offer a higher quality of education compared to a local community college.\n2. The focus of different institutions can also vary. For example, a research university like Yale may focus more on research and less on teaching, while a community college may focus more on teaching and less on research. This can affect the type of information that is taught and the way it is taught.\n3. The size of the institution can also play a role in the differences between schools. Larger institutions may have more resources and a wider range of courses, while smaller institutions may have fewer resources and a more focused curriculum.\n4. Finally, the location of the institution can also play a role in the differences between schools. For example, a school in a large city may have more opportunities for internships and other hands-on learning experiences, while a school in a rural area may have more opportunities for research and other academic pursuits.\nOverall, the differences between schools can be attributed to a variety of factors, including the resources available to them, their focus, their size, and their location.\n← Why are colleges and universities so different from each other (Yale vs a local community college) but all of the information taught in school is the same for their respected fields ?\nWhy are colleges and universities so different from each other (Yale vs a local community college) but all of the information taught in school is the same for their respected fields ? →",
    "Answer": "I studied physics at a reasonably high-ranked school, and I can tell you definitively that 90% of what I learned that actually stuck was from working with other students, not from lectures. The caliber of fellow students is hugely important in my opinion, and you simply get better students at better schools. I also contest your statement that the information taught is the same. With better professors and better students, more can be covered in the same amount of time, so subjects can be taught more completely and more thoroughly.",

    "Answer": "There's not really a 100% established answer for why, or what causes people to have fetishes. The more common explanations are a result of conditioning and psychological development.  Conditioning is where a non-typical object, body part, or act is associated with sex by pairing it with typical erotic stimulation, either visual, audio, or physical. So for example someone could develop a sexual fetish for women in boots by watching porn where women are wearing boots, or just by touching themselves in an arousing way while looking at the boots themselves. Psychological Development suggests that the roots for sexual fetishes often develop during childhood. It can arise from things such as social taboos, if it's forbidden or frowned upon to show a specific body part (such as calves) then maybe seeing a naked calf when you hit puberty could be considered arousing.",

    "Answer": "Because with a computer mouse you move it exactly X distance on the table so the cursor moves Y distance. With a joystick, you essentially 'toggle' the cursors movement in any given direction, for a certain length of time, until the cursor reaches what you need. It's also less accurate because you're dealing with a fixed joystick instead of a mouse that you can move all the way across your desk if you wanted to. This is my interpretation of it, anyway",

    "output": "1. The main reason for this is the osmotic pressure of the solution.\n2. The osmotic pressure is the pressure that must be applied to a solution to stop water from passing through a semi-permeable membrane into the solution.\n3. In a solution, the molecules are in constant motion.\n4. If the solution contains a solute, then the molecules are attracted to the solute molecules.\n5. The force of attraction between the solute molecules and the solvent molecules is called osmotic pressure.\n6. This osmotic pressure is responsible for the movement of water from a high concentration solution to a lower concentration solution.\n7. If the concentration of the solute in the solution is higher than that of the surrounding solution, then the water will move from the surrounding solution to the solution.\n8.

    "Answer": "The sugar and electrolytes in Gatorade and other sports drinks actually increase how much water you absorb into your blood stream. This can be perceived as too much fluid and your body will try to get rid of it if you aren't actually dehydrated. Normal water, on the other hand, lacks the sugar and electrolytes that promote water absorption so it stays around in your gut longer.",

    "Answer": "Ebola has no cure, or even a real treatment. It never really went away. It's just that humans aren't commonly exposed to it (it probably normally lives in bats), and when they are it tends to kill quickly enough that it burns itself out. So you see a series of fairly quick and nasty outbreaks in the areas in which infected bat populations come in contact with humans, in west and central Africa.  Plague is different, in that it's curable with antibiotics. It lives in various rodents, and occasionally breaks out because it too has never really gone away. If it happens in a richer country, it's usually dealt with pretty easily. Isolated cases pop up in the US and Canada now and again, incidentally.",

    "output": "1. Animal eyes glow in certain colours when shone with a torch or light because the colour of the eyes is determined by the amount of pigment present in the eyes.\n2. The eye is made up of three layers. The outer layer is the sclera, which is the white part of the eye. The middle layer is the choroid, which is the vascular layer that supplies blood to the retina. The innermost layer is the retina, which contains the photoreceptor cells that convert light into electrical impulses.\n3. The colour of the eyes is determined by the amount of pigment present in the retina. The more pigment present, the darker the eye will appear. The colour of the eyes is also affected by the amount of blood flow to the retina. The more blood flow, the brighter the eye will appear.\n4. When light is shone on the eyes, the pigment in the retina absorbs the light and the blood vessels in the choroid reflect the light back out of the eye.

    "Answer": "Many especialy night active animals have a layer of reflective tissue behind the light sensing cells at the back of the eye. That allows them to caputer more light in their light sensing cells. Additionaly that makes the eyes act as a retroreflector (meaning they will reflect light back paralell to the incomming light) like in the bottom image here: _URL_0_ . The color comes from the tissue that surrounds the lightsensing cells absorbing some of the light.",

    "Answer": "CVV codes are not mandatory, it is up to the person/company as to whether or not they want to require it or not. In some cases their Merchant provider will offer cheaper rates on transaction when CVV is used, as it leads to less fraud however some retailers choose not to do that. Many merchants still refuse to include a security code field in their online checkout forms, because they believe that doing so may confuse some of their customers or otherwise put them off and lead to lost sales. It's also a violation of PCI compliance to store CVV numbers, which helps reduce fraud but since the CVV can't be stored it means that the buyer has to have their card with them at time of purchase (again that is good in terms of anti-fraud), but some companies do believe that can hurt sales.",

    "Answer": "Hi there i tattoo and its exactly how they said. The needles dont need to penetrate too deep and the more times you go over it the darker it becomes you want to go from lightest to dark. You cant take dark back. We water down the black in different amounts or whatever colors and just like water color painting we blend in the shading/colors. White is not the proper way to do a greyscale tattoo. White is meant for accenting and highlighting. Multiple needles at different sizes are also key to this process with the right amount of voltage and speed, and plenty of lubrication for the skin to not be damaged.",

    "Answer": "The Russian Revolution is actually two revolutions, the February revolution and the October revolution (Stalin, btw, was involved in neither). During World War 1, in February 1917, a bunch of workers in Russia started a strike, and basically everybody ended up joining it, including the army and eventually some key figures of the Czar's government. They forced the Czar to step down and give power to the Provisional Government, that was supposed to organize free elections, but ended up being removed from power in November by a group of Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin and Trotsky. The basic reasons were that the Russians were losing WW1, and that there was a lot of poverty and hunger. Also, the Czar was very unpopular because he taxed heavily and was very dictatorial. It turned out that the Provisional Government really didn't do that much better, so that gave Lenin the chance he took to get some support for this second revolution.",

    "prompt": "Question: \"PTSD is a cultural product\" what does that mean?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” means that the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder is a product of the culture in which it was developed. This statement is based on the fact that the criteria for diagnosing PTSD were developed in the United States and are based on the experiences of American soldiers.\n2. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” is a controversial one and has been the subject of much debate among mental health professionals. On the one hand, some argue that PTSD is a real disorder that can be diagnosed and treated effectively. On the other hand, some argue that PTSD is a cultural construct that is influenced by the experiences and values of a particular culture.\n3. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” is based on the fact that the criteria for diagnosing PTSD were developed in the United States and are based on the experiences of American soldiers. The criteria for diagnosing PTSD were first developed in the 1980s by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) and were based on the experiences of American soldiers who had been deployed to Vietnam. The criteria for diagnosing PTSD were later updated in the DSM-5, the latest edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, which is used by mental health professionals in the United States.\n4. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” is also based on the fact that the experiences and values of a particular culture can influence the way in which PTSD is diagnosed and treated. For example, in some cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be diagnosed in women than in men, as women are more likely to be exposed to traumatic experiences such as sexual assault and domestic violence. In other cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be diagnosed in men than in women, as men are more likely to be exposed to traumatic experiences such as war and violence.\n5. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” is also based on the fact that the experiences and values of a particular culture can influence the way in which PTSD is treated. For example, in some cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be treated with traditional healing practices such as prayer and meditation. In other cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be treated with Western medical interventions such as medication and therapy.\n6. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” is also based on the fact that the experiences and values of a particular culture can influence the way in which PTSD is understood. For example, in some cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be seen as a spiritual or religious issue, while in other cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be seen as a psychological or medical issue.\n7. The statement “PTSD is a cultural product” is also based on the fact that the experiences and values of a particular culture can influence the way in which PTSD is prevented. For example, in some cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be prevented through the use of traditional healing practices such as prayer and meditation. In other cultures, PTSD may be more likely to be prevented through the use of Western medical interventions such as medication and therapy.\n8.

    "Answer": "If I understand this correctly, what its saying is that PTSD only exists as a recognised disorder because of the ability we have to study it. It never used to be recognised. In wars, for example, people would get it and be labelled as cowards, because it wasn't understood what the sufferers were going through. I think its similar to our modern day view of depression. Maybe back in the day, depressed people were seen as someone who just needs to harden up, a bit of a downer all the time. Now, though, we realise its a proper disorder that the patient can't control, as opposed to a voluntary sadness. In the same way, now that we have studying PTSD and its effects, we can recognise it as a disorder, not just someone being anxious and touchy and aggressive.",

    "Answer": "Whole eyes are really tricky to transplant for a few reasons: 1. The retina dies in only 2-4 hours without a blood supply. The donor and recipient would have to be right by each other. 2. The retina is part of the brain, so if a donor is brain dead, the eye would be dead too. You have to harvest the eye right after the donor's heart stops. 3. You have to connect the optic nerve, which has 1.3 million individual nerves that need to link up. 4. You need to suppress the immune system so it doesn't recognize the new eye as a foreign and attack it. (Although this isn't as bad as for other organs since the eye is generally protected from the immune system.) Actually this stuff isn't that far off. Researchers have already transplanted eyes in mice who survived for 200 days. But they aren't sure how much vision those mice had restored. Still, even 30% vision restored gives people independence and is better than complete blindness.",

    "output": "3D vision.\nFirst, we will look at the first part of the question:\n\"What is the eye trick?\"\nThe eye trick is the illusion that is created by the image that is being displayed on the monitor. This illusion is created by the fact that the image is not actually three-dimensional, but rather two-dimensional. This means that the image is flat, and does not have any depth or dimension to it.\nNow, let's look at the second part of the question:\n\"How does the eye trick work?\"\nThe eye trick works by the fact that the human eye is not able to distinguish between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. This means that when we look at an image, we are not able to tell whether it is actually two-dimensional or three-dimensional. This is because the human eye is not able to distinguish between the two.\nNow, let's look at the third part of the question:\n\"Why is the eye trick so effective?\"\nThe eye trick is so effective because it is able to create an illusion that is so realistic. This is because the human eye is not able to distinguish between two-dimensional and three-dimensional images. This means that when we look at an image, we are not able to tell whether it is actually two-dimensional or three-dimensional. This is because the human eye is not able to distinguish between the two.\nNow, let's look at the fourth part of the question:\n\"How can the eye trick be used to create an illusion?\"\nThe eye trick can be used to create an illusion by creating an image that is not actually three-dimensional, but rather two-dimensional.

    "Answer": "You're correct that white and black would provide the greatest contrast, but the primary issue isn't contrast. Highway signs are \"retroreflective,\" meaning that at night, when you shine your headlights on them, the light not only illuminates the sign, but the sign also directly reflects a good amount of that light back at you. Black backgrounds would not be efficient retroreflectors (since black absorbs most light, reducing reflectivity), plus they would be difficult to see at night since the sky is black. Green was chosen since the eye is highly sensitive to green, it is clearly visible day and night, and it is a good retroreflector. Green is a common choice in many countries, including Canada, Japan, China, and Australia. Many European countries opt for blue backgrounds with white text or white backgrounds with black text.",

From an econ/financial perspective it just became too expensive to build quality cars. Labor costs for automotive companies kept going up because unions kept wanting more benefits and higher pay for less work. The companies can't redistribute the extra costs to the consumers because that will just drive them to their competition even faster so they did the only thing they could and cut down on quality.",

    "Answer": "Numbering is just a nice way of differentiating the new cards from the old cards. Occasionally it switches. For instances, years ago, NVidia was making cards with thousand series (4XXX up to 9XXX). Then for some reason, they decided not to do 10XXX and started with hundred series (2XX up to currently 6XX). As for specs, there really isn't an ELI5 answer to most of it. In General, for all Cards, a Higher RAM number indicates a better card (Some higher end GFX cards have 2 GB of RAM [Though its usually listed as 2048 MB of RAM]). As for the Other Specs, AMD and NVidia have diverged in how they make their cards, so there aren't a whole lot comparisons you can make anymore just looking at each cards specs. You could go to a PC Repair shop and ask them to install it for you, though it might run you like $50 or more to have that done.",

There are of course super simple ways to manually make them into ringtones. It's just that when you pay for the song, you are paying for a copy to be downloaded and played, not to be used as a ringtone.   I wouldn't mind so much if it was a 49¢ purchase, but the average one is $1.29, the same price as the whole song, while only a handful are 99¢.  TLDR: greed",

    "Answer": "DVD-R and DVD+R are two DVD formats. This means that the way the data is stored on the discs themselves is slightly different. From a user's perspective they both function the same and have almost the same capacity (-R has 7MB more). DVD-R came first and is the \"old\" format. DVD+R is newer and has some advantages. For example its format is more resilient to errors (can handle more scratches). DVD-R can be read by any DVD player, new or old. However DVD+R can only be read by more recent DVD players. CDs come in only one format.",

    "Answer": "Peristalsis works like this: _URL_0_ Stick a drinking straw in a cup full of water, place your thumb over the end of the straw, and lift it out of the water so that the straw is full of water but no longer in cup. Pinch the straw flat with the thumb and forefinger of your other hand up near where your thumb is covering the end and pull down, still squeezing and covering the end with your other thumb.  That's basically how peristalsis works. The muscles pinch the \"tube\" in a small area (be it your esophagus, intestines, etc) and force its contents along with a wave motion. It pinches, pushes a little ways, and releases. The next muscle pinches it again, pushes it a little ways, and releases. This process repeats until the contents get where they're going.",

    "Answer": "Brains are complex things. While dreaming you are thought to be basically consolidating the memories you want to keep and not keep, and you create scenes in your mind involving things that were important to you recently (consciously or unconsciously). So while your brain is doing all of that, your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth are still wired in. Incoming stimuli from any one of those sensory organs can be implemented into the seemingly chaotic mess of neural activity that we call dreaming.",

The IC engine is composed of the following parts:\n• Cylinder: It is a closed vessel in which the piston moves up and down.\n• Piston: It is a piston-like object that moves up and down inside the cylinder.\n• Crankshaft: It is a rod with a crank at one end.\n• Valves: It is a device that allows the flow of air and fuel into the cylinder and exhaust gases out of the cylinder.\n• Fuel: It is a substance that burns to produce heat.\n• Spark Plug: It is a device that generates a spark to ignite the fuel in the cylinder.\n4. When the IC engine is running, the piston moves up and down inside the cylinder. This movement is converted into rotary motion by the crankshaft.\n5. The rotary motion is then transmitted to the propeller through the transmission.\n6. The propeller is a rotating blade that pushes the water backward, thus moving the boat forward.\n7. The propeller is connected to the transmission through a shaft.\n8. The transmission is a device that changes the speed of the engine. It has two main parts: the gearbox and the clutch.\n9.

    "Answer": "The small propeller moves a small stream of water, just as wide as the propeller, at a speed that's much faster than the boat moves. This stream of water has more mass than you'd think, because water is quite heavy, and it has a momentum (m • v). All this momentum goes into the boat, because momentum is conserved (the old physics rule \"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\") so since the boat has a larger mass it gets a smaller increase in velocity. It's surprisingly effective because well designed boats experience very little water friction, that's how you can paddle a canoe that floats your weight, plus the canoe, plus your stuff.",

    "Answer": "I work at a research university, and system administration of our supercomputers falls under my team's responsibilities. What ours supercomputer do is simulation. They simulate things like chemicals interactions, nuclear reactions, electronic systems, and many other things. In many areas of research, it is a lot cheaper to develop models that can be simulated in supercomputers to test ideas, instead of experimenting with real world systems. Our research groups use their models on our supercomputers to research solar energy, advanced films, water treatment, artificial intelligence, medical imaging, and a lot more. All of this requires a lot of processing power because 1, these are complex models involving the interactions between multiple dimensions of variables; 2, because being able to perform calculations faster means either getting results sooner, or being able to simulate systems in more detail, with better results.",

In terms of the war, Italy was defeated by the Allied forces in 1943, while Germany was defeated in 1945.\n2. Explain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nItaly regards its history in terms of its involvement in WW2 different from its \"ally\" Germany because Italy was defeated by the Allied forces in 1943, while Germany was defeated in 1945.\nItaly's involvement in WW2 began when it entered the war in June 1940 as an ally of Germany. Italy's involvement in the war was largely due to the influence of fascist dictator Benito Mussolini, who was seeking to expand Italy's territory and influence in Europe.\nItaly's involvement in the war was largely limited to the Mediterranean theater, where it fought against the Allied forces in North Africa and the Balkans. Italy was defeated by the Allied forces in 1943, when the Allies invaded Sicily and the Italian government surrendered to the Allies.\nGermany, on the other hand, was the primary aggressor in WW2 and was responsible for the majority of the war's death and destruction. Germany's involvement in the war began in 1939, when it invaded Poland and started WW2. Germany's involvement in the war was largely due to the influence of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, who was seeking to expand Germany's territory and influence in Europe.\nGermany's involvement in the war was primarily in Western and Eastern Europe, where it fought against the Allied forces and the Soviet Union. Germany was defeated by the Allied forces in 1945, when the Allies invaded Germany and the German government surrendered to the Allies.\nItaly and Germany were both defeated in WW2, but their involvement in the war and their respective outcomes were different. Italy was defeated by the Allied forces in 1943, while Germany was defeated in 1945. Italy's involvement in the war was largely limited to the Mediterranean theater, while Germany's involvement in the war was primarily in Western and Eastern Europe.\nIn conclusion, Italy regards its history in terms of its involvement in WW2 different from its \"ally\" Germany because Italy was defeated by the Allied forces in 1943, while Germany was defeated in 1945. Italy's involvement in the war was largely limited to the Mediterranean theater, while Germany's involvement in the war was primarily in Western and Eastern Europe.",
    "Answer": "Because at one point during the war (1943) the Italian King had Mussolini arrested and at this point Italy was not part of the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan) anymore. Germany, from an ally became an invading force of Italy. Also, the anti-Jewish laws were repealed by the new Badoglio government while the war was still going on.  Basically, by the end of the war, Italy was not viewed as one of the 'bad guys' anymore. So while for Germany there were the [Nuremberg trials](_URL_0_), where all the atrocities committed by Germany came into surface, no such trial took place against Italy.  So it's a combination of two things: a. Italy probably didn't commit atrocities comparable to Germany; b. any war crimes Italy did commit did not undergo the same level of inquiry of those commited by Germany.",

    "Answer": "In the case of fireflies (I don't know if it is representative for all organisms) it's an enzyme called \"luciferin\" that undergoes a chain of reaction that emits light. It first reacts with ATP, the basic energy provider to almost all processes in our body, turning into \"luciferyl adenylate\". This in turn can react with Oxygen, turning into \"oxyluciferin\". The interesting thing about this reaction is that it produces oxyluciferin in an excited state. That means that one of its electrons has more energy than usual and is moving at a higher speed further away from the molecule than in it's basic, unexcited form. The electron will eventually \"fall down\" from this high energy state, \"dumping\" the energy difference in form of a photon of a certain color corresponding to the energy difference. This is the basic mechanism that produces the light of most light sources besides incadescent.",

    "Answer": "Well, most people use the word \"clone\" to mean something other than it actually is. I blame the popular sci-fi use of cloning to refer to creating an exact duplicate of a person, along with their memories and personality and such. In real life, cloning means to take the DNA of an animal, and create a new baby animal with the same DNA. So it's more like creating a new identical twin baby of the original creature, and not at all like creating an exact copy of that creature.",

    "Answer": "Shampoo is a type of soap designed for your hair. It gets grease out of your hair.  You should only shampoo your head. Don't put shampoo on the ends of your hair if you're a girl, it's too harsh and will damage your hair. Conditioner puts the life back in hair after being shampooed. It moisturizes it. Body soap is a soap designed for your skin. It gets dirt off your skin. You can't just wash dirt and grease off with water because water and oil don't mix. Soap is an \"emulsifier\" it means that it makes it so water can wash away oil. 2-in-1 is conditioner and shampoo mixed together. So you only have to use one product to wash your hair. There's a lot of rumors that it's bad for your hair. From what I've learned, if you have very fine hair then it's better to not use a 2 in 1. But most hair works just fine for a 2 in 1.  3 in 1 is shampoo, conditioner and body soap all mixed in one. Guys usually use this. You can literally put it on any part of your body.",

    "Answer": "Basically, it comes down to sensing versus perceiving. Generally everyone senses the same things the same way, from vision to taste, excluding those with sensory deprivations (colorblindness, deafness, etc.).  Perceiving is a different story. It's all in your head. We attach meaning to different sensations. Like when you see your SO and get happy if you're in a great relationship. Basically you attach meaning to different sounds you hear. People tend to like major keys that are consonant, but of course not all because different people attach different meanings based on their experiences! Hope this helps, this is the first ELI5 explanation that I've done! Feel free to ask further questions!",

    "Answer": "You need a second camera that is filming from a slightly different perspective, just like humans can see in three dimensions because they have two eyes set slightly apart. (In computer animation you can arbitrarily create a second perspective on a scene, so it's easier but it still requires extra rendering to produce the film.) You play back footage from both perspectives at the same time, but the viewer wears polarized lenses which filter the image so that the left eye sees one thing and the right eye another. You may recall older 3D using colored lenses for the same purpose. You can also process a standard film to give it computer-generated 3D effects. This is a lot cheaper than filming a real 3D movie, but the result tends to be ugly.",

    "Answer": "Nuking an asteroid would be like taping an M80 to a boulder. Some postgraduate students from Leicester University did the math on the asteroid used in Armageddon (awful movie) it would take 800,000,000,000,000 terajoules of energy to blow up that chunk of rock. The largest nuke mankind ever set off only put out 418,000 terajoules of force. To nuke a large asteroid to the point of blowing it up you'd need 1.9 BILLION of the worlds biggest nukes. _URL_0_",

    "Answer": "Training. Specifically, what is known as \"stress inoculation.\"  This is why new recruits in the military have to complete tasks while being yelled at and generally messed with by their instructors- a crude imitation of the stress of combat. It's why high quality police training involves responding to crises amidst all sorts of artificial stressors like simulated ammunition and panicked victims. It's why professional boxers get hit again and again and again long before stepping into the ring.  If you are routinely exposed to a certain kind of stress, you can become desensitized to it. Mental armor, so to speak. You can be trained to *act* when faced with stress rather than freezing up.",

    "Answer": "A cellar is usually colder then the outside as it is kept dark and surrounded by cold dirt. Humidity is based on not only the amount of water in the air but also the temperature of the air. So when air gets down into the basement and gets cooled down its humidity increases. All life needs water to thrive. Basements with a lot of humidity will have a lot more humidity so it is easier for mold to get the water it needs.",

    "output": "​\nIn general, it is not possible to have more than one type of flu running in your body at the same time.\nFor example, if you have a bacterial infection, it is unlikely that you would also have a viral infection.\nThis is because bacterial infections are caused by bacteria, while viral infections are caused by viruses.\nHowever, there are some cases where it is possible to have more than one type of flu running in your body at the same time.\nFor example, if you have a cold, you may also have a sinus infection.\nThis is because the cold virus can cause an infection in the sinuses.\nAnother example is when you have the flu, you may also have a bacterial infection.\nThis is because the flu virus can weaken your immune system, making it easier for bacteria to enter your body and cause an infection.\nIn conclusion, it is not usually possible to have more than one type of flu running in your body at the same time, but there are some exceptions.\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the difference in the symptoms of a cold and the flu?\nAnswer: ​The most likely reason for the difference in the symptoms of a cold and the flu is that colds are caused by viruses, while the flu is caused by a virus.\nThe symptoms of a cold are usually milder than those of the flu, and they include a runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat.\nThe symptoms of the flu are usually more severe, and they can include a high fever, chills, and body aches.\nThe flu can also lead to complications such as pneumonia and bronchitis.\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the difference in the duration of a cold and the flu?\nAnswer: ​The most likely reason for the difference in the duration of a cold and the flu is that colds are caused by viruses, while the flu is caused by a virus.\nThe symptoms of a cold usually last for about a week, while the symptoms of the flu can last for up to two weeks.\nThe flu can also lead to complications such as pneumonia, which can take longer to recover from.\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the difference in the severity of a cold and the flu?\nAnswer: ​The most likely reason for the difference in the severity of a cold and the flu is that colds are caused by viruses, while the flu is caused by a virus.\nThe symptoms of a cold are usually milder than those of the flu, and they include a runny nose, sneezing, and a sore throat. The symptoms of the flu are usually more severe, and they can include a high fever, chills, and body aches.\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the difference in the incubation period of a cold and the flu?\nAnswer: ​The most likely reason for the difference in the incubation period of a cold and the flu is that colds are caused by viruses, while the flu is caused by a virus.\nThe incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after exposure to a virus.\nThe incubation period for a cold is usually about a week, while the incubation period for the flu is usually about two weeks.\nThe flu can also lead to complications such as pneumonia, which can take longer to recover from.\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the difference in the contagious period of a cold and the flu?\nAnswer: ​The most likely reason for the difference in the contagious period of a cold and the flu is that colds are caused by viruses, while the flu is caused by a virus.\nThe contagious period is the time during which a person is able to spread the virus to others.\nThe contagious period for a cold is usually about a week, while the contagious period for the flu is usually about two weeks.\nQuestion: What is the most likely reason for the difference in the recovery period of a cold and the flu?\nAnswer: ​The most likely reason for the difference in the recovery period of a cold and the flu is that colds are caused by viruses, while the flu is caused by a virus.\nThe recovery period is the time it takes for a person to fully recover from an illness.\nThe recovery period for a cold is usually about a week, while the recovery period for the flu is usually about two weeks.",
    "Answer": "Just to clarify a little more... \"Flu\" does not just mean illness. It is specifically illness caused by *Influenza* viruses. In fact 'flu' is short for 'influenza'. The term \"bacterial flu\" is misleading because it means a bacterial infection occurring because your immune system has been weakened by the flu virus. So you can't have bacterial flu without having \"actual\" influenza caused by the influenza virus. So your answer is in your question. You can only have what is confusingly described as \"bacterial flu\" if you have viral flu. If you're using the word \"flu\" to describe any illness with similar symptoms then yes, you can definitely have as many infections as you would care to pick up. It will eventually kill you. Immune disorders (like AIDS) are such a problem because you end up with every disease and infection out there and it becomes impossible to stop the sufferer getting sick and dying from any and all kinds of infections.",

When those banks started to fail, they were big enough that they caused massive, very bad effects to the economy of the *entire country* and frankly even extending out to foreign countries as well.  Since those companies are *too big to fail,* the government needed to step in and help them to not fail in order to prevent another Great Depression.",

    "Answer": "Alcohol is a chemical that affects almost every organ in the human body, but in particular it interferes with the brains' cells abilities to communicate with each other. If you drink alcohol faster than your liver and kidneys can process it, it begins to build up in the bloodstream and hence gets carried to your brain, where it basically blocks some of the normal brain behaviour from occurring.

    "Answer": "This was covered in part by This American Life recently.  _URL_0_ \"So, here's the thing about the codes that people don't realize. It's not like he has a piece of paper in his pocket. It's like, here are the nuclear codes. It doesn't work that way. How it works is, there's a military officer that walks around with what's called a Football. That officer, he's got more experience than I do. And at the end of the day, if the president goes off the handle and says, nuke these guys because I don't like them, we're taught, in the military, as officers, that we have a moral obligation to refuse orders that are not moral. So if my commander tells me to do that, and it is not moral, I have an obligation to tell him to [BLEEP] off.\"",

    "output": "1. Noise is a form of energy and is transmitted through air, water, or other mediums. When the sound reaches the eardrum, the vibration of the eardrum is converted into nerve impulses by the inner ear. These nerve impulses are then transmitted to the brain through the auditory nerve. The brain interprets these nerve impulses as sound.\n2. The physical sensation of pain is caused by the activation of nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. The activation of these nerve cells causes the release of chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, which are responsible for the sensation of pain.\n3.

There are several factors that contribute to the sensation of pain, such as the intensity of the sound, the duration of the exposure, and the individual's sensitivity to sound.\n4.

This is because deaf people do not have the same sensory input from their ears that hearing individuals do.

    "Answer": "Pain is how our body signals to our brain that we're in a situation that's potentially causing us harm, so we're motivated to try to get out of that situation.  Loud enough noises can physical damage your ear, and as a result, we've evolved so that somewhere before the threshold of damage to our delicate ear parts, a loud enough sound will cross a pain threshold.  That pain is your ear telling your brain that being around these loud noises is bad for you, and you should try to get yourself away from them before your hearing is damaged.",

Humans can do this too, for example fish liver oil, whale blubber etc,. Whale blubber contains high amounts of vitamin C. Two, Different animals have different dietary needs. We primates require Vitamin C in our diets but we can manufacture other vitamins , many other mammals, including cats and dogs, *can actually synthesize their own vitamin C* so it isn't a dietary requirement.  Cats require vitamin A from animal sources, they cannot process carotenoids(from plants) into vitamin A. Dogs, and us, can eat a carrot and make vitamin A. Different animals have different needs and different capabilities to manufacture vitamins or to dietary input into essential compounds.",

    "Answer": "It refers to how big donors get more access to politicians. If the average person contacts a national-level politician, they'll probably get a form letter reply from an intern.

Things like ambassador jobs to Caribbean island nations are one of the more common ones. But high-level advisory and even cabinet-level positions are often given to big donors too.",

    "Answer": "Colors are a response your brain makes to picking up certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation striking receptor cells in your brain. When this happens, those cells send signals to your brain, and your brain creates the image. Certain combinations of stimulation on those cells cause your brain to generate different colors, to help further discriminate, because this is a beneficial evolutionary adaptation (harder for things to blend together). Color itself is not a property of light or anything. Rather, a product of your brain interpreting it.",

    "Answer": "The right way is to utilize more calories than you consume. All diets that succeed do this, all diets that fail, fail to do this.  People may be more or less effective at eating less calories, or at burning more, but the equation is always the same.  It is possible that combinations of foods make you feel better or worse and that these things enable you to stick with it more. It is certainly healthy to avoid HF corn syrup in general, but from a pure weight loss perspective it is not all that important. Cravings can certainly happen with sugar swings, but again...thats about your ability to sustain a pattern of reduced calorie intake and increased calorie burning.  Eat the right number of calories. Then...eat a good balance of foods. Exercise. That's the recipe for both health and weight loss.",

    "Answer": "Newton said gravity is a mysterious force that affects everything with mass. He didn't know what causes this force but he did create some useful equations. Then Einstein came up with General Relativity. He says that mass bends space-time and that's why things are attracted to each other. For Example, if you put 2 heavy balls on a trampoline, they warp the trampoline and move towards each other. This is just an analogy, but it helps give you the idea. This warping of space-time has some other side affects, which allows General Relativity to predict and explain thing that Newton's law doesn't (like small changes in the orbit of planets, light bending around stars, and clocks in GPS satellites running slower).",

    "output": "1. The genes that increase the likelihood of getting certain diseases (like cancer) are called cancer genes.\n2. The cancer genes are the genes that are mutated due to certain factors like chemicals or radiation.\n3. The mutation of these genes causes the uncontrolled cell division which leads to the formation of cancerous cells.\n4. The cancerous cells then spread to other parts of the body and cause the disease.",
    "Answer": "It's kind of misleading to think of the gene as being exclusively for cancer-causing purposes. Typically the \"cancer genes\" people talk about are variations on a gene that codes for sometime useful.  Like when people say they have the BRCA1 gene (the gene most commonly associated with genetic breast cancers), they don't actually mean they have a genetic sequence in a place where everyone else has nothing. Everyone has a BRCA1 gene, it's just that normally it codes for tumor-suppressing proteins. In people with certain mutations in that region, however, the proteins that it codes for are not produced correctly and thus do not properly suppress the uncontrolled growth of cells.",

    "Answer": "Mostly psychological. When a person has good sense of humor, it generally means they are happy, socially confident and likely to have a healthy perspective on life. But this has exceptions because humor has a dark side. There are people who use self-defeating humor; also humor is used to criticize and manipulate others through teasing, sarcasm and ridicule. So being funny isn't necessarily an indicator of good social skills and well-being. It all depends on the kind of humor the person uses.",

    "output": "100% correct\nDistillation is the process of separating two liquids of different boiling points by heating a liquid until it vaporizes and then cooling the vapors so that the desired liquid condenses. This process is used to separate alcohol from other liquids in the fermentation process and also to concentrate alcohol.\nThe fermentation process produces a liquid with a high alcohol content, but it also contains other substances such as water, sugars, and acids. Distillation is used to separate the alcohol from these other substances. The fermented liquid is heated in a still until it vaporizes. The vapors are then cooled so that the alcohol condenses and can be collected. The other substances remain in the still and can be discarded.\nDistillation is also used to concentrate alcohol. The fermented liquid is heated in a still until it vaporizes. The vapors are then cooled so that the alcohol condenses and can be collected. The other substances remain in the still and can be discarded.

It consists of a pot, a condenser, and a collecting vessel.\nQuestion: Why is distillation used to separate alcohol from other liquids?\nAnswer: 100% correct\nDistillation is used to separate alcohol from other liquids in the fermentation process because alcohol has a lower boiling point than water. This means that when the fermented liquid is heated, the alcohol will vaporize before the water. The alcohol can then be collected and the other substances remain in the still.\nQuestion: What is the difference between a still and a distiller?\nA still is a device used to distill liquids.

    "Answer": "Once the liquid that they are making the liquor out of has been fermented, and has alcohol in it, then the alcohol needs to be concentrated. Alcohol has a slightly lower boiling point than water, so they heat the liquid (which is called a mash by the way) to just below the boiling point of water. The alcohol boils off while the majority of the water remains liquid, separating the two. The alcohol vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a more concentrated and higher proof liquid. Then they generally age it in a barrel.",

    "Answer": "Although it doesn't look it, the ballast is pretty solid. It distributes the load from the passing trains, keeps down unwanted vegetation (there aren't many plants than can grow on rocks) and enables water to drain away. This last one is very important. Where I live, there was some flooding back in May, and parts of the railway line were submerged. The water, having just washed down from the hillsides, was very muddy, and so the ballast is caked in mud. And so right now the line is closed for a couple of weeks while they clean the ballast. This is because the mud is preventing the water from draining away properly. In the winter, the wet mud would likely freeze, and water expands when it freezes: and so it might actually lift the tracks slightly. If we have a winter where the ballast freezes, unfreezes and freezes again a few times, that could loosen the tracks and make them dangerous.",

    "output": "1) The new car smell is a phenomenon that is often experienced by car owners. It is a unique smell that is often described as a mixture of plastic, leather, and other chemicals. The smell is usually present in the first few months of owning a new car and is often associated with the new car experience.\n2) The new car smell is caused by a combination of factors. The most common cause is the off-gassing of the materials used to construct the car. These materials include plastics, leather, and other synthetic materials. As these materials are exposed to air, they release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) into the air. These VOCs are what give the car its unique smell.\n3) In addition to the off-gassing of the materials used to construct the car, the new car smell is also caused by the use of chemicals in the manufacturing process. These chemicals are used to treat the materials used in the car, such as the leather seats and the plastic dashboard.

    "Answer": "If you do not make enough money to get subsidized, you may make little enough money to qualify for Medicaid.  Unfortunately, due to Florida's decision not to expand the Medicaid program, there is a gap between the maximum income to qualify for Medicaid and the minimum income to qualify for subsidies. If you fall within this gap, you probably will not be able to get affordable insurance. (You'll be exempt from the individual mandate, though, so you mostly just aren't affected.)",

    "Answer": "Actually, there is! [See this!](_URL_0_ snow)  That said, the reason you don't usually hear thunder during snowstorms is because snow actually suppresses the sound! It basically absorbs it, since it's just fluff in the air, drastically reducing the distance it can be heard! While a regular thunderstorm can be heard for miles and miles, a thundersnow is limited to just 2-3 miles of sound.  As for why it's so rare to see a storm like that? You need moisture in the air to produce a thunderstorm. In the summer this is easy, as warm air holds water better. Unfortunately, or fortunately, cold air holds less moisture, and as a result you need special conditions for thundersnow. A warm, wet front trailing or leasing a cold front can produce it.  Places like the gulf of Mexico will see it more often, due to readily available warm moist air!",

    "Answer": "Primarily scale. On a smaller explosive, the cloud will be, well, smaller. You'll be able to see all the little imperfections around its edges, and those imperfections will take up a larger proportionate area of the total structure. In a nuclear cloud, it's just so big that you don't notice the same-sized imperfection in the mushroom shape as much.",

    "Answer": "I suggest that you read a few button tutorials for embedded systems like arduino or raspberry pi. The processor can read the state of the buttons at any time. So they do this in a loop. When they notice the button is pressed they start a timer and wait for the button to be released. By measuring the time it takes for you to release the button they can do different functions. To save on battery they might not do it in a loop but rather have an interrupt logic in place that will signal the CPU whenever the state of a button changes and make it run the button checking logic. There may also be additional logic on the circuit board that detects if the power button have been held down for some time without the CPU reacting and do certain functions like toggling the power. This can be useful if the CPU have crashed or if the device is out of power.",

    "Answer": "\"asking for a friend.\" Borrowing [this answer](_URL_0_), we learn: \"You have seven vertebrae in your neck (cervical vertabrae).  Breathing is controlled by nerves that come out above the third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae. Severing or severely injuring the spinal cord at this level will paralyze the diaphragm and keep you from breathing. It will also paralyze all other muscles below this level. Either the carotid or vertebral arteries supplying blood to the brain may also be damaged by the shear forces of the neck being snapped, referred to as dissection. This would cause ischemia to the areas of the brain supplied by those arteries. The most immediate cause of mortality in this situation would be respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest and death.\" So, not exactly. But you have to remember that, in movies, bad guys fall down dead instantly from long-range gunshots, but good guys can take repeated blows to the head and body with blunt, heavy instruments with no apparent ill-effects.",

    "Answer": "It's so that the card won't be limited to being from a single person or a group. \"Wishing you a happy holiday\" can come from either your single brother or from both your grandparents. If it said \"I wish you a happy holiday,\" groups and couples wouldn't buy that one, and vice-versa.  So the company that makes the cards would have to make multiple versions of the card. That incurs additional expense-- and, simply due to chance and demographics, one version would outsell the others, so they would have to try and calculate how much that discrepancy would be, in order to not produce not enough or too many of each one. Much easier to just make them more generic, so they make sense coming from either individuals or groups. The people giving the card can add personal messages that make any vagueness clear, anyway.",

    "prompt": "Question: Why does inbreeding increase the likelihood of birth defects?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. The likelihood of birth defects increases with inbreeding because the genetic variation within the population decreases.\n2. This is because inbreeding involves mating between close relatives, which increases the chances of inheriting identical copies of genes from both parents.\n3. When the same genes are inherited from both parents, the offspring has a higher chance of developing genetic disorders or birth defects.\n4. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of inherited diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, and hemophilia.\n5. The reason for this is that these diseases are caused by recessive genes, which can be passed on from parents who are closely related.\n6. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in a single gene, such as Huntington’s disease.\n7. This is because the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n8. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome and Turner syndrome.\n9. This is because the likelihood of a chromosome being duplicated or missing increases with inbreeding.\n10. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of inherited diseases caused by mutations in multiple genes, such as cancer.\n11. The reason for this is that the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n12. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy.\n13. This is because the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n14. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the Y chromosome, such as Klinefelter syndrome.\n15. This is because the Y chromosome is passed down from father to son and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n16. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome.\n17. This is because the X chromosome is passed down from mother to daughter and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n18. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the autosomal chromosomes, such as Down syndrome.\n19. This is because the autosomal chromosomes are passed down from both parents and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n20. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA, such as Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy.\n21. This is because the mitochondrial DNA is passed down from mother to daughter and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n22. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the Y chromosome, such as Klinefelter syndrome.\n23. This is because the Y chromosome is passed down from father to son and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n24. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the X chromosome, such as Turner syndrome.\n25. This is because the X chromosome is passed down from mother to daughter and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n26. Inbreeding can also increase the risk of genetic disorders caused by mutations in the autosomal chromosomes, such as Down syndrome.\n27. This is because the autosomal chromosomes are passed down from both parents and the likelihood of two parents carrying the same mutation increases with inbreeding.\n28.

    "Answer": "Everybody has bad genes in them - I remember a scientist quipping that there are enough genetic defects in the human genome to kill a person several times over. However, all humans get two sets of genes, one from each parent. As a result, many of the 'defects' you might have in your genes are simply overridden by the working copy you got from your other parent. However, when you inbreed, you've got two people with very similar genetics, which means that its more likely that they'll both have identical copies of a defective gene (or gene set). That means the offspring is more likely to receive both copies of the defect from their parents, losing that protection that normally came from receiving two sets of chromosomes. Do not that inbreeding doesn't increase rates of mutations, just the likelihood of genetic defects that are already existing in the parents being expressed fully. Also, this question gets asked a lot. Use the search bar next time.",

(3 different colors, like RGB or aRaGaB are together colorless again) The exotic hadrons are made out of more than 3 quarks and that could be done like so: 4 quarks R, aR, B, aB (red + antired + blue + antiblue = colorless) 5 quarks RGB R aR (red green blue, red antired = colorless) So yeah normally the 4quark hadrons aren't more stable than two mesons of 2 quarks. so we call it exotic  }-ish",

    "Answer": "Varies by state In some states, the exit corresponds with what the mile marker is. So if the exit is at mile marker 25, it's exit 25. In case of multiple exits or new exits added at mile 25, then it's subdivided into exits 25a, 25b, 25c, etc. In other states, the exits go in numerical order for the duration of the highway. There's an ordering system which runs east-west or north-south from lowest to highest. So the first exit is exit 1, second exit is exit 2, and so on til the end. When new exits are added, that's where you see exit 2a, 2b, 2c, etc.",

    "prompt": "Question: Why do we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1) In our eyes, there is a layer called the retina. It is a layer of light-sensitive cells that convert the light energy into nerve impulses. The retina is the part of the eye that senses light and sends signals to the brain.\n2) When we look at a bright light, the retina is exposed to a large amount of light. This can cause damage to the retina and lead to temporary or permanent loss of vision.\n3) To protect the retina, the eye has a natural defense mechanism called the pupil. The pupil is the opening in the center of the iris, the colored part of the eye. The pupil expands in response to bright light, allowing less light to enter the eye. This helps to reduce the amount of light reaching the retina and protect it from damage.\n4) When we look at a bright light, the pupil expands to its maximum size to reduce the amount of light entering the eye. However, when we look away from the bright light, the pupil takes time to adjust back to its normal size. During this time, the retina is still exposed to a large amount of light, which can cause temporary or permanent damage.\n5) This is why we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light. The spots are caused by damage to the retina due to the excessive light exposure.\nThe answer is concise and to the point, explaining the reason behind why we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light.\nThe answer explains the mechanism of the pupil in protecting the retina from damage.\nThe answer explains the reason behind why we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light.\nThe answer explains the mechanism of the pupil in protecting the retina from damage and the reason behind why we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light.\nThe answer is concise and to the point, explaining the reason behind why we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light.

    "Answer": "It won for discovering strong evidence of gravitational waves. Usually things that cause fluctuations in gravity move too slowly to tell, but large, violent events cause waves: fluctuations in the gravitational field. These were predicted a century ago but it took these guys and a clever experiment to finally observe one.  Classic Newtonian understanding of gravity was that it would propagate infinitely: if you could instantly remove an object, the lack of gravity from it would be immediately felt. This experiment shows that it propagates at the speed of light, and radiates out like light or other forces.",

    "prompt": "Question: Why are 3d models used for games, in a T-Pose when not in use or before an animation ?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "3d models are used in games for a variety of purposes. One of the most common is to create a T-Pose when the model is not in use or before an animation. This is done for a number of reasons, including:\nTo save memory and processing power: When a model is not in use or before an animation, it is not necessary to load all of the model’s geometry and textures. By defaulting to a T-Pose, the model can be loaded with minimal geometry and textures, saving memory and processing power.\nTo allow for more efficient animation: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to animate it. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to keyframe the model’s movements.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render it. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient physics simulation: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to simulate its physics. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s mass and inertia.\nTo allow for more efficient AI: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to program its AI. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of hair and clothing: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render hair and clothing. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of effects: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render effects. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of lighting: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render lighting. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of reflections: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render reflections. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of shadows: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render shadows. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of textures: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render textures. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of transparency: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render transparency. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of volumetric effects: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render volumetric effects. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of particle effects: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render particle effects. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in 3D space.\nTo allow for more efficient rendering of post-processing effects: When a model is in a T-Pose, it is easier to render post-processing effects. This is because the model’s bones are in a neutral position, which makes it easier to calculate the model’s position and orientation in",
    "Answer": "It's the best way to model or sculpt it. it's also more or less a standard, so you can easily take a skeleton from another model and place it on your working model. It allows for easier deformation modelling too. You can also model a character with their arms down, but then when you want to animate those arms upwards the deformation becomes a lot harder to get right.",

Partly because ScarJo got pregnant during filming and they had to write her out of some action scenes, but when the only woman on the team is the one who gets kidnapped and needs a man to rescue her, it seems off. That, combined with the addition of a romantic subplot annoyed people who liked that for once, a female lead in a film didn't need a love story to be cool.  Oh, and the line about being sterilized got interpreted by some fans to mean \"Because I can't have kids, I am a monster.\" Instead of as \"I can't have kids, because of the horrible things they did to me, which resulted in my being a monster.\" Which offended women who thought this meant Whedon was treating women as baby-factories who have no worth unless they are pumping out children.

Furthermore, the cost living in Russia is lower than other western countries, although their social welfare isnt as good, but still acceptable in their own standard. And finally, being a somewhat \"dictator ship\", they can easily cut the money at some departments and transfer it to their higher priority one. It's the same with NKorea, where 60% people in starving thread, and still can launch rocket, although quality is questionable.

    "output": "1. If cellphones are replacing landlines, why aren't there versions of white pages for cellphones?\n2. How are landlines any different?\nAnswer: 1. If cellphones are replacing landlines, why aren't there versions of white pages for cellphones?\nCellphones are replacing landlines because cellphones are more convenient.

    "Answer": "Problem Is there are multiple cell phone companies, so if each had their own book it would be incomplete and inconvenient to have to look through 5 books to find a person. Land lines used to be one company in an area generally. It was a weird deal because they were a company, but a utility and basically a monopoly. Even after it was deregulated it still stayed much the same. And even if someone does somehow arrange to get one combined cell list, it's still going to be very incomplete because people could choose to be unlisted and a large percentage would. I know I would.",

    "output": "1. Yes, it's called \"dream deja vu\".\n2. It is a phenomenon in which a person experiences a sense of familiarity or recognition while dreaming.\n3. Dream deja vu can occur when the dreamer has experienced a similar situation in real life or when the dreamer has a reoccurring dream.\n4. Dream deja vu can also occur when the dreamer has a dream that is similar to a waking life experience.\n5. The dreamer may feel as if they have experienced the dream before, even though they have not.\n6. Dream deja vu is a common experience and is not usually cause for concern.\n7. However, if the dreamer is troubled by the experience, they may wish to consult with a mental health professional.\nAnswer: Yes, dream deja vu is a thing. It's when you have a dream that feels like it's already happened before. It's a very common experience and can be very vivid. It's not always easy to explain, but it's usually just a weird feeling.\nWhat is the difference between deja vu and déjà rêvé?\nIs it possible to have dream deja vu?\nIs it possible to have déjà vu in a dream?\nWhat does déjà rêvé mean?\nIs it possible to have déjà rêvé?\nWhat does it mean if you dream of a déjà vu?\nCan you have a déjà vu in a dream?\nWhat is the difference between deja vu and déjà rêvé?\nDeja vu is a feeling of having already experienced the present situation, while déjà rêvé is a feeling of having already dreamed the present situation.\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible to have dream deja vu.\nAnswer: It is possible to have déjà vu in a dream, but it is not common.\nAnswer: Deja rêvé is a French term meaning \"already dreamed.\" It is a feeling of having experienced a dream before, even though you have not actually dreamed it.\nAnswer: Yes, it is possible to have déjà rêvé.\nAnswer: It is possible to have déjà rêvé, or the feeling that you have already dreamed a dream. This can happen when you have a very vivid dream, or when you have a dream that is similar to one you have had before.\nAnswer: If you dream of a déjà vu, it could mean that you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed out in your waking life. It could also be a sign that you are feeling nostalgic or sentimental about something in your past.\nAnswer: Yes, you can have a déjà vu in a dream.\nAnswer: There is no scientific evidence to support the idea that déjà vu is a real phenomenon. However, some people believe that it is a sign that they have experienced a past life.\nAnswer: Deja vu is a French term meaning \"already seen\". It is a feeling of familiarity with something that one has not actually experienced before. Déjà rêvé is a similar feeling, but it is associated with dreams.",
    "Answer": "One of the prevailing theories on Déjà Vu is that sometimes our wires get crossed (metaphorically) and the sensory input goes through the region of our brains for memory formation and recall before going to conscious thought. I mind tags information based off of where it came from, so it sees that some of the stimuli came from our senses, but the similar stimuli came from our memory. It makes us feel like we've seen this exact before, when it's all coming from the same input.",

    "Answer": "The idea behind juries is that you don't want to turn judges into an elite ruling class that has total power over people. That kind of power is easy to abuse. Plus, laws are supposed to be a reflection of society itself determining what rules it wants to follow, so having \"society itself\", in the form of a jury of the accused's peers, determine whether or not the law was broken seems only fitting.",

    "Answer": "The Federal Reserve is essentially a government agency that is operated privately. It was created by the government, it's leaders are appointed by the government, but it is independent. This is often referred to as being \"independent within the government.\"  By making it independent and quasi-private, the Federal Reserve can run monetary policy more efficiently, without every single thing being politicized and subject to constant interference and squabbling from politicians. This isn't to say that there's no oversight, just that it's less silly.",

    "Answer": "Hats have been popular articles of men's attire from ancient times until 1960. Most men throughout history wore a cap or hat whenever they went outside. In 1960, President-Elect Kennedy attended his inaguration hatless and thereafter fashion changed rapidly to dispense with headgear except as environmental conditions required. From about 1920 to 1960 men found it increasingly hard to use hats as an article of fashion due to the headroom in cars. As the headroom got smaller, hats got harder to wear. First the large tophat style hats vanished, then even smaller fedoras. About the only place men still feel comfortable wearing headgear in transport is in the cab of large trucks.",

    "Answer": "The Verizon employees who are on strike have not had a contract since August of 2015. Negotiations with the company have not produced the results they felt were appropriate and they have elected to strike based on that. Some of the issues they have raised are wages, pension freezes, Verizon working to make it easier to dismiss staff and move jobs overseas, among other things.",

    "Answer": "First, texture has a lot to do with food. The sensations of chewing, moving food around in your mouth, and taking a bite-sized solid piece of omelet versus a fluffy bit of scrambled egg with a lot of air in it will add to a difference in flavor. Next, your omelet usually has a big chunk of \"other stuff\" in its middle whereas the scrambled egg approach would have little bits of other things all throughout them (assuming you are making them with more than just cheese). This changes the way those additional bits cook and exchange tastes with each other, changes their moisture content, and changes the distribution of flavours that you get in each mouthful. Finally, scrambled eggs are mixed around and they're cooked very uniformly without a \"browned\" exterior, but omelets usually have a little more deep-cooking in their exterior surface, and its different more-burned chemicals can result in a different flavor profile.",

    "Answer": "You can't really ask the government to just let you take existing but currently uninhabited homes like that, it'd basically amount to stealing from the owner. Some places have laws about letting property be considered properly 'abandoned' in which case any supposed owner that fails to maintain the property can lose it to someone that does, but that's not universal or necessarily easy. Ignoring that, though, where are these empty houses? A lot of them are somewhere pretty useless for a homeless person. Having a home doesn't mean much if you can't get a job in the area to hold down the home. Just giving homes to homeless people and calling it a day won't really work - you have to address the fact that most homeless people are facing issues of which being homeless is more of a symptom than a direct problem.

    "Answer": "Songs are protected by copyright which protects the song from people copying it. Food on the other hand is a product that is composed of ingredients that are most likely not under patent protection. Also many of the generic brands you mention are actually made by the same company they are trying to imitate. The company just makes a lesser quality version of the name brand for stores to sell as a cheaper version.",

Based on this logic, pretty much the worst thing you could do is damage your ability to reproduce, so your balls are absolutely packed with nerve endings that will send intense pain signals to your brain if they sense injury, because losing your reproductive ability is equally as bad as death.",

    "Answer": "The computer (the operating system) keeps a list (index) of the files, the name and the location on the disk. When you \"delete\" the file, the computer marks that entry as no-longer-needed. It doesn't delete the entry, nor does it alter the actual file at all. Next time it needs to store something on the disk, it looks for available space; if it find an entry that says \"deleted\", it will overwrite the entry and overwrite as much of the file space as it needs. The recycle bin is simply another \"list\" that points back to all the files that say \"deleted\" in the real file list. When you \"empty\" the recycle bin, you're deleting this extra list, but not changing anything in the real list.  For bonus complexity: disk space is assigned in \"clusters\". A file that takes only 100 bytes will actually take (perhaps) 4,000 bytes on the disk. But the computer will only actually write the first 100 bytes - the other 3900 byes will still be the original, deleted, file.",

The harder a material is, the less likely it is to be deformed or scratched.\n11. This is why diamond is used in tools and jewelry, while graphite is used in pencils and lubricants.\n12. Graphite is also less dense than diamond.\n13. The less dense a material is, the more easily it will float in a liquid.\n14. This is why graphite is used in pencils and lubricants, while diamond is used in jewelry and tools.\n15. Finally, diamond has a higher melting point than graphite.\n16. The higher the melting point of a material, the more heat it can withstand before it melts.\n17. This is why diamond is used in tools and jewelry, while graphite is used in pencils and lubricants.\n18. In conclusion, diamond and graphite are both made up of carbon atoms.\n19. However, the difference in bonding strength, crystal structure, and density between the two materials makes diamond more rigid, transparent, and durable than graphite.\n20. These properties make diamond ideal for use in jewelry and tools, while graphite is better suited for use in pencils and lubricants.\n21. Understanding the differences between these two materials can help us better appreciate their unique properties and uses.\n22. By understanding the differences between diamond and graphite, we can better appreciate the unique properties and uses of each material.\n23. This knowledge can be applied to a variety of fields, from science to art to engineering.\n24.

    "Answer": "In a diamond, the carbon atoms are all neatly lined up in a crystaline structure. Photons entering the lattice work from the right angles will pass right through it virtually unimpeded. In graphite and other forms of carbon, the lattice work isn't there, and the atoms are in what you'd call a pile. So photons encounter resistance no matter where they hit it.",

    "prompt": "Question: How can you identify musical meter?\nAnswer the question as precise as possible and add no irrelevant context.\nExplain your answer by reasoning step by step in a concise manner.\nAnswer:",
    "output": "1. A piece of music is said to be in a certain meter when the beat is divided into a certain number of equal subdivisions. The most common meter in Western music is 4/4 time, also called common time.\nThis means that there are four beats in a measure, and each beat is divided into four equal subdivisions. Each of these subdivisions is called a quarter note.\n2. In 4/4 time, the first beat is the strongest, and the fourth beat is the weakest. This is indicated by the time signature, which looks like this:\n3. The time signature tells us how many beats there are in a measure, and what kind of note gets the beat. In 4/4 time, there are four beats in a measure, and a quarter note gets the beat.\n4. We can identify the meter of a piece of music by counting the beats and subdivisions. In 4/4 time, we would count “1, 2, 3, 4” to the beat.\n5. We can also identify the meter of a piece of music by looking at the time signature. In 4/4 time, the time signature would look like this:\n6. We can identify the meter of a piece of music by listening to it. In 4/4 time, the beat is usually felt as a strong pulse, and the subdivisions are felt as a weaker pulse.\n7. We can identify the meter of a piece of music by looking at the notation. In 4/4 time, the notation would look like this:\n8. We can identify the meter of a piece of music by looking at the tempo marking. In 4/4 time, the tempo marking would be “allegro” or “andante”.\n9. We can identify the meter of a piece of music by looking at the dynamics. In 4/4 time, the dynamics would be “forte” or “piano”.\n10. We can identify the meter of a piece of music by looking at the articulation. In 4/4 time, the articulation would be “staccato” or “legato”.\n11.

    "Answer": "Other repetitive patterns, such as loudness of notes, in pop music, bass and snare drum hits are closely synced to the meter.  Listen for arpeggios on bass, guitars or pianos that are multiples of the meter. If music is less rhythmic, like just long slow legato notes on violins or synth pads, it will be harder to recognize. There is a less emphasized \"downbeat\" for you to find",

    "output": "1. Bees make perfect hexagons by using the Golden Ratio.\n2. The Golden Ratio is a mathematical proportion that appears in nature and has been used by artists and architects for centuries.\n3. The Golden Ratio is a ratio of two numbers that is always greater than one and less than two.\n4. When the ratio is applied to a hexagon, it creates a perfect shape with equal sides and angles.\n5. Bees use the Golden Ratio to construct their hives, which are made up of hexagons.\n6. By using the Golden Ratio, bees are able to create a strong and efficient hive that can withstand the elements and provide a safe place for the queen to lay her eggs.\n7. The bees use their mandibles to cut the wax into hexagons, which they then use to construct the hive.\n8. The bees also use the Golden Ratio to determine the size of the hive, which is determined by the size of the queen bee.\n9. The bees use the Golden Ratio to ensure that the hive is the perfect size for the queen bee to lay her eggs and for the bees to store honey.\n10. By using the Golden Ratio, bees are able to create a perfect hive that is both strong and efficient.\n11.

    "Answer": "Highways are sprayed with a salt solution in winter to prevent the formation of ice. Certain sections of highway are near water supplies and protected wilderness areas however. These sections are salted less in order not to contaminate the surrounding ecosystems. They put the signs up to warn you that because there's less salt, there will likely be more ice.",

    "Answer": "Hey brohan, solving Differentials is just like integrating derivatives. Cake. So first, just look at my name. It is a differential equation by itself, dy/dx = e^x.  1st step you need to do is make sure all the y is one 1 side and all the x is on the other side. So my equation turns to dy = e^x dx. Now you can integrate to get rid of the dx, and you will get: y = e^x That's it. Now, there might be more complicated problems, but basically, just try to simply everything so that you can easily integrate, and make sure you group the terms on different sides.",

Our color vision is usually a matter of our vision system interpolating between the colors detected by our three flavours of cones in our retina.

But then consider that a small percentage of human females are \"tetrachromats\". For them, there are 4 types of color receptors in their retina. For them, the perceived color is interpolated between 4 different points. You have to imagine this in 3d now, like a 3 sided pyramid with 4 point of detected color, and some interpreted color point somewhere in the 3d space of the pyramid.

    "Answer": "The UK and the US have two different systems for broadcast TV signals. The US uses a system called NTSC, and the UK uses a system called PAL. PAL is slightly better than NTSC to start with, but converting an NTSC signal to PAL degrades it even further. All the major US networks now broadcast an HDTV signal as well. That should be directly compatible with an HDTV broadcast in the UK and the quality should be indistinguishable. But I have no idea what the agreements are between the US news outlets and the British news outlets to exchange video clips so it may be that whatever source you're using for news is limited to NTSC clips.",

    "Answer": "Part of what allows Herbivores to grow as large as they do is that the Digestive Systems in Herbivores are optimized for extracting every bit of protein available from the food they eat. Their digestive tracts can also make some proteins from food that lack proteins. A good example is a a cow's Digestive Tract: It has four stomachs, all for getting the most nutrient possible out of every bite.  Also, plants aren't necessarily devoid of protein. Plants have Keratin, which most predators, and humans, can't digest. Herbivores however, usually can digest it. This greater diversity to what a Herbivore can eat allows them to have access to a surprising amount of protein and nutrients.",

The war was caused by a number of factors, including the Soviet Union's desire to expand its territory, Finland's desire to maintain its independence, and the international political climate of the time.\nThe Soviet Union was a large and powerful country, and it had ambitions to expand its territory. In the late 1930s, the Soviet Union was in the midst of a major industrialization program, and it needed access to resources such as iron ore, which Finland had in abundance. The Soviet Union also wanted to establish a buffer zone between itself and its potential enemies, such as Germany and Sweden.\nFinland, on the other hand, was a small and relatively weak country. It had been independent since 1917, and it was determined to maintain its independence. Finland had a small population and a limited military, and it was dependent on its neighbors for food and other supplies. The Finnish government was also concerned about the potential threat posed by the Soviet Union, and it was determined to resist any attempts by the Soviet Union to annex Finnish territory.\nThe international political climate of the time also played a role in the outbreak of the Winter War. The Soviet Union was a member of the Soviet Union, and it was allied with Germany, which was also seeking to expand its territory. The Soviet Union was also concerned about the possibility of a German invasion of the Soviet Union, and it was determined to prevent any such invasion.\nIn conclusion, the Winter War was caused by a number of factors, including the Soviet Union's desire to expand its territory, Finland's desire to maintain its independence, and the international political climate of the time.\nWhy did the Winter War happen?\nWhat were the causes of the Winter War?\nWhat were the causes of the Winter War and what were the consequences?\nWhat were the causes and consequences of the Winter War?\nWhat were the causes of the Winter War and what were the consequences of it?\nWhat were the causes and consequences of the Winter War?

    "Answer": "Relations between Russia and Finland had been strained since WWI.  Russia felt that Finland was weak, and that they would be able to easily seize a decent chunk of territory. Most of the rest of Europe was distracted by Germany gearing up to start WWII, and so the Russians felt that nobody else would really do much to help Finland if they invaded.",

    "output": "1. Light travels in optical fibers by the process of total internal reflection.\n2. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation, and electromagnetic waves travel through the space as a transverse wave.\n3. Electromagnetic waves can be propagated in a medium only if the medium has a certain index of refraction.\n4. The index of refraction of a medium is the ratio of the speed of light in that medium to the speed of light in vacuum.\n5. The index of refraction of a medium depends on the nature of the material of the medium.\n6. The index of refraction of a material depends on the number of electrons present in the material.\n7. When a material has a high number of electrons, the electrons interact with the light wave and the light wave is slowed down.\n8. When a material has a low number of electrons, the electrons do not interact with the light wave, and the light wave is not slowed down.\n9.

    "Answer": "When data is transmitted over a wire, the wire is turned on and off very quickly. Thousands of times per second, it checks if the wire is currently on. If the signal is off, that is interpreted as a 0. If it's on, that's a 1. Light travels through fiber optic cables. It's basically done the same way, but instead of electricity it uses flashes of light.",

A police officer cant arrest you for just being in possession of a digital copy of a movie.

    "Answer": "in statistics, its very hard to get an exact number. Most of the calculations for certain statistics come with that factor, a margin of error. Its basically the amount of possible variance in the answer. so 20% with a margin of error of 5% means the actual answer could be from 15%-25% but its definitely somewhere in there.",

    "Answer": "The bullet is launched out of the gun by an explosion that superheats the air and produces a loud BAM sound. The gas/air that carries that sound wave doesn't have anywhere to go except out with the bullet. A silencer basically extends the barrel and helps that \"explosion air\" diffuse in other directions so that the resulting explosion from the gunshot is much quieter. Movies and games that have a \"pew pew pew\" sound with the silencer attached are doing it wrong - it really is still an explosive sound, just heavily subdued, like a brick hitting a sandbag or something.",

    "Answer": "For sexually reproducing species, incest is often problematic because closely related family members are likely to share genetic problems with you that are then exacerbated in the children of incestuous couples. For this reason, many species have some sort of control against incest, typically behavioral. In humans, that control is revulsion at the idea of having sex or even thinking about sex with people who we had close contact with growing up. If we were not disgusted by envisioning family members engaged in sexual acts we might instead be aroused. This would create an evolutionary pressure against the aroused group because their children and their children's children wouldn't be able to breed as well and the family arousal trait would be out-competed by the the family disgust trait.",

If you wake up during a dream, your brain hasn't had time to try to forget it. Partially forgotten dreams, either by waking up before the memory has faded or by the mind failing to completely forget it, will seem much duller than a fresh dream.",

However, rubbing alcohol is typically diluted with water and contains other substances that are not present in alcoholic beverages, such as denatured alcohol, which contains additives that make it unpalatable and potentially toxic if ingested. 3. Additionally, rubbing alcohol is often consumed in small amounts and for short periods of time, which may not be enough to produce a significant intoxicating effect. 4.

    "Answer": "You've sort of got it the wrong way round. The camera LENSES are round, because round lenses bend light much better. But the film the image is captured on is rectangular, for the same reason that all pictures are usually rectangles, easier to frame and they are easier to put onto walls. Modern camera sensors have just continued this. Also when light is bent by a round lens, the images around the edges are often distorted, by using rectangle sensors you are just cropping these out and getting a better image.",

    "Answer": "When you breathe in through your nose you're filtering the air before it goes into your lungs, and pulling it through a smaller opening, forcing you to inhale slower taking deeper breaths. You exhale through your mouth because it's a bigger opening and you want to get the 'bad air' out as fast as you can.  Your nose also helps regulate the temperature of the air you're breathing. When it goes in your mouth it goes very quickly into your lungs, and if it's too cold it can be jarring to your lungs. I'd guess, when it's way too hot out, like today, it also serves to cool it down a bit.",

    "Answer": "It's because of the \"first past the post\" method of determining the winner. Whoever gets the most votes wins, rather than the candidate having to secure a simple majority of 50% plus one. Third parties end up skewing the results and acting as \"spoilers\". There have been successful third parties — the Republican Party, for one. There's also the matter of the two main parties doing everything they can to keep viable third party candidates off the ballot or handicapped in one way or another. Ranked choice voting is one solution to this rather undemocratic feature of our system.",

    "Answer": "Not quite 5, but I'll give it a shot. Blood type refers to the type of cell marker that exists on the outside of your red blood cells. There are 3 types- A, B, and O. If you have A, B is considered foreign so you will have anti-B antibodies. The same can be said for A if you have B type blood.  If you have O, it is neither A nor B so you make antibodies for both A and B.  AB blood types have no antibodies since both types are present on their cells.  Type ABs are referred to as \"universal recipients\" because they have no antibodies in their blood and can therefore receive any type of blood without fear of the body rejecting it. Type Os are the universal donors under most condition but this can vary depending on other more complicated factors since as I mentioned before they have anti-A and anti-B antibodies. These types are genetic. A and B are dominant to O, and if you get an A from one parent and a B from another, you will be AB (co-dominant).",

    "Answer": "Vulgar Latin uses more vocabulary that made it into modern Romance languages, and the sentence structure is often more like the modern Romance languages too. So stuff like: occasionally, you'll see the relative pronoun (qui quae quod) used to mark indirect discourse instead of accusative + infinitive constructions. The pronunciation is also different, but that probably won't matter in your class. Most people I've spoken to have said they found Mediaeval Latin 'easier' than Classical Latin. And the subject matter is often more church-focused, so you'll run into lots of new ecclesiastical vocabulary often borrowed from Greek (eg episcopus for bishop, angelus for angel/messenger (of God)), or new meanings for old words (eg Dominus for the Lord, God, rather than the head of a household)",

    "Answer": "People commenting here don't know what they're talking about. Birds do get fat the closer you get to the cold extremes (arctic, mountain peaks). You've never seen one because, I assume, you haven't been to these types of places. Furthermore, you wouldn't know how fat the bird is until you kill and butcher it, but I promise, there are fat birds. Yes, flight is a big part of their survival, but so is fat in the cold weather. As with most things, there's a balance. When colder season come, birds store fat. Not enough that they cannot fly anymore, but they do store fat. When it's time to migrate, a lot of that fat gets burned off.",

    "Answer": "Assuming that all humans alive today survived, there's a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience that could be used to quickly bypass lots of steps along the way. As an example of this, check out [the best Commodore 64 games](_URL_0_) from the mid 1980's, and compare that to the winners of the [2010's Commodore 64 Demoscene](_URL_1_) where people take all of the advances in programming from the last 30 years and apply them to old hardware. It's true that modern computers are designed and built in part by computers, so it'd probably take several years to rebuild simple computers by hand, then use those to build more and more complex computers from there. But it'd take far less than 70 years to \"catch up\" because we have the advantage of knowing the full history.",

    "output": "1. What are the advantages of buying a house instead of renting?\nRenting a house is a good choice for many people. It allows you to live in a nice neighborhood without having to worry about upkeep or maintenance. However, there are some advantages to buying a house.\nFirst, it can be cheaper in the long run. When you buy a house, you're not just paying for the house itself; you're also paying for the land it's on. This can be a big savings over time, especially if you live in an area where property values are increasing.\nSecond, buying a house can give you more stability. When you rent, you're always at the mercy of your landlord. If they decide to raise your rent or sell the property, you're out of luck. But if you own your own home, you have more control over your living situation.\nFinally, buying a house can be a good investment. Over time, property values tend to increase, so if you sell your house later on, you'll likely make a profit.\n2.

    "Answer": "Equity in something means how much of a stake you have in its ownership. If you pay for the house in cash, then you own it, and you can borrow against it. If you take out a loan to buy it, then you only own it conditionally (so long as you keep making your payments to the bank). If you already have a mortgage on the house, then it will be harder to use it as collateral for a loan because you're already in debt on it.",

    "Answer": "Men didn't prefer virgins because they got to be the first. It was about legacy. Everything they had and were would be passed on to a son, and they wanted to make sure that boy really was his son.  Marrying a virgin helped ensure this. Not only could the husband be sure she was not pregnant with another man's child, but she had followed the norm of society, and could be expected to continue to do so when married. Conversely, a woman known to have had sex out of marriage defied society, was considered a harlot who could not be trusted to remain faithful. In this scheme, a widow is almost as good as a virgin. She followed the rules and just had an unlucky break, so there was no reason to believe she would be any less faithful. Also, widows often inherited their husband's property and were more wealthy than a young woman still living with her family.",

    "Answer": "Non-profits are still business that have expenses. Sometimes it is an organization that pays salaries and overhead expenses. What is leftover from however they produce income is what is provided to their charity or organization.  As far as getting paid for odd jobs, that usually falls under the consultant category. Basically a company or individual seeks the advice of someone who specializes in a certain field or area. The most popular example would be something like website design where big companies can have an inhouse team, but small companies or non-profits, will contract someone to create their site... in which case the one time cost is significantly cheaper than a full time employee.  But there are people who specialize in some weird stuff and their specialty is sometimes needed. For example, while in college I met an archaeologist student who specialized in analyzing dung (basically human waste), well that speciality landed him a consulting role for a book that won a Pultizer.

    "Answer": "There is definitely the potential for fracking to pollute groundwater. The truth is, we don't really know for sure exactly how much the underground geology is altered when they use fracking. They inject an extraordinary amount of fluid into the ground under an extraordinary amount of pressure, fracturing the rock formations around the drilling site, which allows for easier extraction of natural gas and/or oil.. It's possible that these rock formations may have been separating oil or gas deposits from groundwater, and after the shale is fractured, these two may begin to mix, where they couldn't before.",

Then, when hand to hand combat did occur, there was no need for a sword so heavy it would break a man's ribs through iron, just something to stab him with would do just fine. I always thought it was interesting that through Korea people quit using personal body armor and now it's coming back. Modern soldiers look about as covered up as a knight these days.",

    "Answer": "Hardcore fans argue otherwise, but the majority of anime *is* poorly-animated entertainment fodder marketed towards teenage boys. This is coming from someone who enjoys some anime series, but it's a medium that most Japanese natives look down on for this reason, too. Because anime is deemed a niche genre unto itself, even in its country of origin, *everything* (including shows that feature paedophilia, rape and so on) is tarred with the same brush. There's also the weeaboo phenomenon: Westerners who get into anime are mind-blown at this myopic exposure to one of the world's most unique cultures, and rather than research the parts they would inevitably find disagreeable, they latch onto fictionalised Japan as some kind of utopia willing to let pudgy white kids commandeer their culture.",

    "Answer": "Pyramid schemes are 100% effective so long as the number of people joining exceeds the number of people who are already involved. This works because you can use the joiners money to pay off the oldest members. The problem is that the number of fools (while massive) is a finite number. Eventually the scheme cannot maintain cash flow.",

    "Answer": "Think of the radiation like tiny, tiny bullets. When you get radiation poisoning your bodies cells are getting hit by Billion of tiny bullets that go through your body. These bullets can damage things at the cellular level like DNA, causing it to break apart in the cell and killing the cell. These bullets can also break up alot of the molecules like hemoglobin, or hormones that your body needs. Not only does your body take damage but your body has to clean up the corpses of dead cells and the crazy new molecules that radiation has made.",

    "Answer": "all of these answers contain somewhat true points, but something to point out -- no one 'sets' oil prices, not the oil exploration and production companies, not OPEC, not anyone except the market. The two types of oil quoted when people talk about 'oil prices' are WTI (U.S. benchmark) and Brent Crude (North Sea, worldwide benchmark)...and these prices are set by futures contracts that are traded instruments. In other words, the price of oil is determined in much the same way the price of a stock is determined, not like the price of a good/service is determined. OPEC decided not to cut production (Saudi Arabia especially), which had the effect of driving prices down (supply/demand imbalance), but they do not actually decide what price they will be able to sell a barrel of oil.",

    "Answer": "Young girls fine motor skills tend to develop a few years earlier than young boys. This also coincides with schools teaching handwriting, ages 5-8.

    "Answer": "We have binocular vision, by using two eyes our brain receives to separate images with everything shifted slightly left or right. Your brain then takes the images and process them together into a single image, using the differences to give you depth perception and three dimensional vision. For example I am sitting at my computer screen. If I close one eye, then quickly open and close the other my computer screen seems to shift, this is because it's close to me. If I look out the window at a tree down the street and do the same that jump is minimal or imperceptible. This tells me the tree is far away.  Your brain is doing this in real time with the two images to constantly keep up our sense of depth.",

    "Answer": "The same reason eggs get more solid when they cook, I believe. The heat causes some of the proteins to denature. Proteins are kind of like balled-up organic strings. Since they are round, they easily bump past each other in a liquid. When they denature, they partially or completely unravel, and the loose ends get all tangled up with each other, creating a more solid structure.",

    "output": "1985 was a time when the music industry was booming and the youth were embracing it with open arms. The music industry was a multi-billion dollar industry and was one of the most profitable industries in the world. The music industry was dominated by the likes of Michael Jackson, Madonna, Prince, and other artists who were known for their controversial lyrics and music videos.\nTipper Gore, the wife of then-Vice President Al Gore, was a vocal critic of the music industry and its impact on the youth. She believed that the music industry was responsible for the rise in teenage pregnancies, drug use, and other social ills. She also believed that the music industry was responsible for the rise in violence in the United States.\nIn response to her concerns, Tipper Gore formed the Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) in 1985. The PMRC was a non-profit organization that was dedicated to promoting parental responsibility in the music industry. The PMRC believed that parents should be responsible for monitoring their children’s music consumption and that the music industry should be held accountable for the content of its music.\nThe PMRC was met with strong opposition from the music industry and its fans. The music industry argued that the PMRC was trying to censor their music and that it was an infringement on their First Amendment rights. The music industry also argued that the PMRC was trying to impose its moral values on the music industry and that it was an attempt to control the music industry.\nThe PMRC responded to these criticisms by arguing that the music industry was responsible for the rise in social ills and that the music industry should be held accountable for the content of its music. The PMRC also argued that the music industry should be held accountable for the impact of its music on the youth.\nThe PMRC eventually won the battle against the music industry and its fans. In 1985, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) agreed to a voluntary rating system for music. The rating system was designed to inform parents about the content of music and to help them make informed decisions about their children’s music consumption.\nThe RIAA’s voluntary rating system was a major victory for the PMRC and its supporters. It was a major step forward in the fight for parental responsibility in the music industry. The rating system was a major victory for the PMRC and its supporters and it helped to ensure that parents would have a better understanding of the content of their children’s music.\nThe PMRC’s victory in 1985 was a major victory for parental responsibility in the music industry.

The PMRC’s victory in 1985 was a major victory for parental responsibility in the music industry and it helped to ensure that parents would have a better understanding of the content of their children’s music.\nWhat is the Parents Music Resource Center?\nThe Parents Music Resource Center (PMRC) is a non-profit organization that was founded in 1985 by the wife of then-Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore. The PMRC was formed in response to the rising popularity of music with explicit lyrics and content, and was intended to promote parental responsibility in the music industry.\nThe PMRC’s main goal was to create a voluntary rating system for music, similar to the ratings system used for movies. The rating system was intended to inform parents about the content of music and help them make informed decisions about what music their children should be listening to.\nThe PMRC also advocated for a variety of other measures, such as increased labeling of music with explicit content, increased parental involvement in music selection, and increased education about the potential dangers of explicit music.\nThe PMRC’s efforts were met with strong opposition from the music industry and its supporters. Many argued that the PMRC was trying to censor music and that it was an infringement on First Amendment rights. The music industry also argued that the PMRC was trying to impose its own moral values on the music industry and that it was an attempt to control the music industry.\nDespite the opposition, the PMRC was successful in its efforts. In 1985, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) agreed to a voluntary rating system for music. The rating system was designed to",

    "Answer": "They can store nutrients below ground mostly. Think of syrup, which all decidious trees in northern climates produce. The flow of syrup is the tree moving sugars from its lower storage organs to its leaf buds yo support the new growth. Also woody tissue with secondary cell walls are dead so they aren't really supporting as much living tissue as it seems.",

Why in construction, when they lay rebar, is it in a grid pattern?\nAnswer: In the construction, when they lay rebar, it is in a grid pattern because of the following reasons:\nRebar is a steel bar or mesh of steel wires used as a tension device in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures to strengthen and aid the concrete under tension. Rebar is most often used to reinforce concrete in the tensioning of concrete in reinforced concrete and reinforced masonry structures.\nThe rebar is used to strengthen the concrete and provide it with more tensile strength. This is done by placing the rebar in a grid pattern so that the concrete can be distributed evenly and will have the same strength in all directions.\nThe grid pattern also helps to distribute the load evenly, which is important in large structures.\nThe rebar is placed in a grid pattern so that it can be easily removed once the concrete has set. This is important because it allows the concrete to be repaired or replaced if it becomes damaged.\nThe grid pattern also makes it easier to inspect the concrete for cracks or other damage.\nThe rebar is placed in a grid pattern so that it can be easily cut to the correct size. This is important because it allows the concrete to be easily shaped into different forms.\nThe grid pattern also makes it easier to install the rebar, as it can be easily laid out in a straight line.\nThe rebar is placed in a grid pattern so that it can be easily inspected for corrosion. This is important because corrosion can weaken the rebar and cause the concrete to fail.\nThe grid pattern also makes it easier to inspect the concrete for cracks or other damage.\nThe grid pattern also makes it easier to inspect the concrete for cracks or other damage.

    "Answer": "As a wind farm developer, let me direct you to the proper resource: _URL_3_ Essentially:  > \"Wind turbines extract energy by slowing down the wind. For a wind turbine to be 100% efficient it would need to stop 100% of the wind - but then the rotor would have to be a solid disk and it would not turn and no kinetic energy would be converted. On the other extreme, if you had a wind turbine with just one rotor blade, most of the wind passing through the area swept by the turbine blade would miss the blade completely and so the kinetic energy would be kept by the wind.  > Betz Limit Albert Betz was a German physicist who calculated that no wind turbine could convert more than 59.3% of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy turning a rotor. This is known as the Betz Limit, and is the theoretical maximum coefficient of power for any wind turbine.  > the fact is that small scale (1-100 kW) always have lower efficiencies than large scale wind turbines. \"",

    "Answer": "Such is the genius of Thomas Edison. It turns out sound waves are really pressure waves that exert force on your eardrums 'creating' sound. Vinyl is a soft material which is sensitive to subtle changes in force. Therefore to make a recording, an etching needle is placed on the vinyl and when sounds are made it moves the needle up and down according to the pressure exerted by the sound wave. As a result it literally converts a pressure wave into a physical shape. To play back, the opposite occurs. You run a needle over the record and the needle moves a diaphragm back and forth converting the 'shape' of the sound wave back into an actual sound.",

    "Answer": "Let's put it this way - you can't divide something into zero parts. You can divide it into one part, but not zero parts. That's an illogical question (what happens if you divide $10 in zero parts?) There's no answer. Here: $0 x 12 months = I'll give you $0 every month for 12 months. How much money will you have after a year? $0. $12 x 0 months = I'll give you $12 every month, but no months have occurred yet. How much money do you have? $0. $0/12 months = You've made $0 in a year - how much did you make monthly? $0 $12/0 months = You've made $12 in the span of no time at all. How much money did you make monthly? Um...well...I didn't make money monthly. There's no way to calculate this, because there's no time on the scale.",
