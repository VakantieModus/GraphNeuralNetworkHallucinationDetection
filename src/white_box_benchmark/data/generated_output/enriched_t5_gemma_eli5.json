    "output": "The first two plays with a rush, specifically up the middle, are intended to:\n\n1. **Test the middle linebacker:** This is a key defensive player. Running the ball up the middle forces them to react and cover a large area.\n2. **Identify the middle linebacker's coverage:**  This information is crucial for the quarterback to decide how to attack the middle.\n3. **Set the tone:** Running the ball up the middle, even unsuccessfully, establishes a consistent offensive identity and forces the defense to adapt.",

    "Answer": "Keep the defense honest, get a feel for the pass rush, open up the passing game. An offense that's too one dimensional will fail. And those rushes up the middle can be busted wide open sometimes for big yardage.",

This occurs due to **mechanical tension**, meaning the muscle fibers are repeatedly stressed by exercise. \n\nHere's a step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Exercise:**  Muscle contractions during resistance training create microscopic tears in muscle fibers. \n2. **Repair and Growth:**  The body responds to these tears by sending signals to repair the damage. This involves an increase in protein synthesis and a reduction in protein breakdown.\n3. **Muscle Fiber Growth:**  The repaired muscle fibers grow larger and stronger due to the increased protein synthesis. \n4. **Increased Muscle Mass:**  Over time, this process leads to an increase in the size of the muscle fibers.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough (as I very rarely post here), but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth. What happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time. Other factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to \"feed\" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that's an ELI5 for another day.",

The pigmented layer absorbs more UV in the upper layers of the skin, shading the cells underneath from UV and preventing burns (because it's the lower, reproducing cells that matter, the upper ones are disposable protection). Just like sitting outside under an opaque black umbrella would shade you more than sitting outside under a translucent white one.",

A primary varicella zoster infection (chickenpox) in adulthood is indeed associated with increased risk of complications. Most of these complications are due to the intense response by the adult immune system that comes into contact with the virus for the first time. Children have less active immune systems, but usually active enough to clear the virus - making them immune to it thereafter, and are therefore less likely to develop complications with this particular infection. The same goes to hepatitis A: adults develop jaundice, while children are asymptomatic.  Note: a secondary varicella zoster infection during adulthood is called \"shingles\" and is generally less dangerous than a primary varicella during adulthood, due to the immunity that is already present at the time of the second infection.",

    "output": "Your eyes are not physically pressing on each other. The phenomenon you experience is called synesthesia. It's a neurological condition where stimulation of one sense involuntarily triggers another. \n\nHere's the reasoning:\n\n1. **Synesthesia is a neurological condition:**  It occurs when the pathways between the brain's sensory and motor areas become crossed.\n2. **Sensory pathways:** These pathways are responsible for processing sensory information. In synesthesia, the pathway that carries visual information is crossed to the motor pathway.\n3. **Motor pathways:** These pathways control voluntary movements.\n4. **Eye movement:** When you move your eyes, you stimulate the crossed sensory pathway.\n5. **Crossover:** This crossover of sensory pathways leads to the perception of colors or other sensations in a different context, such as synesthesia. \n\nIn essence, your eyes don't press, but the crossover of sensory pathways, specifically the visual pathway, leads to the perception of colors when you move your eyes.",

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",

This jiggling increases their temperature and that heats up the rest of your food. That's why you can't heat oil as easily as you can water. However, metals like iron are *great* conductors of electrons. What makes them good conductors is a little complicated but basically, the reason is that they have a soup of electrons moving from atom to atom with almost 0 energy needed to move an electron from one atom to another.  Thus when the microwave jiggles these electrons, rather than giving energy to the atom, it gives it to the electron which zips around in the soup. The amount of energy given to the soup can get high enough to bypass the natural insulation of the air and cause electrons to jump from the metal and rip through the air. This is called a spark and is basically what happens during a lightning strike.",

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",

This process is still happening, with accents on the Canadian and US sides of the great lakes undergoing vowel shifts at this very moment, and in opposite directions; Canadian and US accents are actually becoming less similar, even among people in the niagara region who live a few km apart. Why? We don't really understand this process at all well. The key thing relevant to your question though is that accents change a lot, that distance and separation make this process easier and more likely, and that neither English nor an American speakers sound much like their 16th century forebears.",

There is a phenomenon called [print-through](_URL_0_) which transfers signal from one layer to the next. Professional audio engineers often store reel to reel tapes \"tails out\". That means without rewinding. It doesn't stop print-through, but it does make it happen later rather than earlier, so on playback it will be heard after a track rather than before.

This would take millions of years and to guarantee that all women experienced it, all who felt pain during childbirth would have to not reproduce.  Think about it like this.

    "Answer": "It's basically painting a transparent picture on top of the black-and-white, and the B/W image provides much of the shading.  In the days before photoshop, you had actual transparent inks with limited tints to choose from, and that's why old hand-colorized photos often look more cartoony. Now, you can pick from a vast range of colors until it more or less matches what you would expect: a white person with fair hair will probably have skin in X color range, unpainted wood furniture is going to be a shade of brown, jeans are almost certainly blue, a military uniform from that era is going to be this particular color, etc.  Plus if you have experience with B/W photography you might have a sense for how some colors will translate to film; they often have a particular range of grey due to the characteristics of a given film. So accurate colorizing mostly comes down to digital painting skill and having a sense for how things would look.",

It's also less flexible. The benefits to having scar tissue is the body can recover from wounds exceptionally quickly - many animals can't create scar tissue, and so wounds can remain open longer and are more susceptible to infection and other problems. Conversely, other animals can regenerate entire limbs whereas we can't. Interestingly, the collagen in your scar tissue is constantly replaced. If your body stops producing collagen (due to certain illnesses), your scars' wounds can actually reopen. The scar is difficult to get rid of because the tissue has been created in a less structured/ordered form than your regular skin (because it was deployed quickly to help heal the wound), but some medical procedures exist to reduce that effect.",

    "output": "The relationship between oil prices and gas prices is complex and influenced by several factors. \n\n**1. Oil and Gas Production:**  Oil and gas are interconnected. Changes in oil production can impact gas prices, but this relationship is not always direct. \n\n**2. Refining Costs:**  Refining oil into gasoline involves significant costs.  Increases in oil prices lead to higher refining costs, which are passed on to consumers in the form of higher gas prices.\n\n**3. Transportation Costs:**  The transportation of oil and gasoline is expensive.  Oil price increases can lead to higher transportation costs, which are reflected in gas prices.\n\n**4. Competition:** The gas market is competitive.  While oil price increases often lead to faster gas price increases, competition among gas stations can also lead to price adjustments.\n\n**5. Storage Costs:**  Gas prices are influenced by storage costs.  Higher oil prices can lead to increased storage costs, which are passed on to consumers.\n\n**6. Market Speculation:**  Market speculation can influence oil prices, sometimes leading to artificial fluctuations.\n\n**In summary:** The relationship between oil and gas prices is complex and influenced by a variety of factors.

    "Answer": "It's usually not noticeable unless you sniff harshly, but one nostril is usually more open and free-flowing than the other.  The nostril that's closed usually swaps back and forth after several hours throughout the day. When a nostril is more closed, it's swollen, because the blood vessels inside the nose are swollen.  During that time, your immune system attacks all the nasty stuff that came into your nose. It's harder to breathe when that happens. But your other nostril is wide open and maximum air comes in.  This combination of having one closed nostril and one open nostril is a super efficient way for your body to both clean the nasties and breathe full air at the same time. If it was all just 1 nostril, then every few hours you would have difficulty breathing.  Air breathed through the nostrils are combined in the back and flow into both longs. One nostril does not lead into one lung.",

    "output": "Cutting down trees to plant other vegetation, like avocado farms, contributes to global warming through the following steps:\n\n1. **Reduced Carbon Sequestration:** Trees absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis. Deforestation reduces this process. \n2. **Increased Greenhouse Gas Concentrations:** More CO2 in the atmosphere leads to a higher concentration of greenhouse gases, trapping heat and causing global warming.\n3. **Soil Degradation:** Clearing forests often leads to soil erosion and loss of organic matter, reducing the soil's ability to absorb CO2. \n4. **Reduced Rainfall:** Deforestation can alter local rainfall patterns, leading to drier conditions which are more susceptible to drought, a contributor to global warming.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "When you cut down highly developed forests to replace them with cultivated land you're seriously lowering the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed. A big tree that is several decades old will take in WAY more CO2 than several seedlings that are planted to replace it. Additionally, all of the undergrowth that is in forests absorbs CO2 but that is all removed for farming. Further, a lot of the time what's done is called \"slash and burn\" which means that the forests are chopped down and the debris is cleared away via a controlled fire, once again adding CO2 (and other harmful chemicals) to the atmosphere. Also, removing well established plants will significantly increase soil erosion and while that may not directly contribute to global warming, it certainly is detrimental to the environment.",

    "output": "Turboprop airplanes do not spin in circles. \n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Rotor design:** Turboprop airplanes have large, flat-mounted propellers, unlike helicopter tail rotors. These propellers generate thrust for forward motion.\n2. **Thrust generation:** Thrust is generated by the propellers, propelling the plane forward. This forward motion counteracts the downward force of gravity, preventing spinning. \n3. **Control systems:** Turboprop airplanes use control systems to manage flight and steer, not tail rotors. These systems include rudders, elevators, and collective throttles. \n4. **Stability:** The plane's weight, center of gravity, and aerodynamic forces are carefully balanced to ensure stability. \n \nTherefore, while helicopters use tail rotors for vertical lift and stability, turboprop airplanes have efficient single-rotor designs that generate sufficient thrust for forward motion and are balanced for stability.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "On a helicopter the main rotor blades are the wings, a plane has fixed wings that use the air to resist the torque of the prop that's trying to make the plane roll (this is also why single prop driven planes roll to one side faster than they can to the other)",

    "output": "**Difference:**\n\n1. **Refrigerant:** Marine air conditioners use a special, ozone-friendly refrigerant designed to withstand the extreme temperatures and humidity on the open ocean. Standard air conditioners use a regular refrigerant.\n\n2. **Durability:** Marine air conditioners are built to withstand harsh marine environments, including salt spray and extreme temperatures. Standard air conditioners are not designed for this.\n\n3. **Capacity:** Marine air conditioners are typically larger and more powerful than standard air conditioners to provide adequate cooling in a confined space.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. Marine environments are extremely different from terrestrial ones. They experience extreme heat, humidity, and salt spray.\n\n2. To survive these conditions, marine air conditioners need a special refrigerant and a design that prioritizes durability.\n\n3. Standard air conditioners are not designed for marine use and would be damaged by exposure to saltwater and extreme temperatures.",

    "Answer": "Caveat - I mess with boats but I'm not expert or pro. In general marine equipment is made with more corrosion resistant materials,such as stainless steel. The A/C on my boat exchanges the heat in the cabin air into water that flows through the other side of the heat pump, so this is an air/water heat pump where most home units are air/air heat pumps. Also some or most marine units are 12 Volt DC power, possibly also 24 volt. I think some few are powered directly off the engine via a 'fan belt'. The reefer on my boat is three way power - 120 VAC, 12 VDC, and propane. I suppose this would be possible in A/C but I've ever heard of this.",

This offers a degree of security compared to holding cash or other assets.\n2. **Accessibility:** Banks are readily accessible and offer various savings options. This makes it easier to manage savings compared to storing cash.\n3. **Liquidity:**  While not always the case, some banks offer liquidity options, allowing customers to access their savings relatively quickly. \n4. **Trust:**  People generally trust established institutions like banks and governments to manage their savings.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* People seek a balance between safety and accessibility.\n* Savings institutions offer a balance of safety and accessibility.\n* People trust institutions to manage their savings. \n* Therefore, people keep savings in potentially unstable institutions.",

    "Answer": "I see two reasons: 1. In most European countries you need a residence permit to open a bank account. In other words, you must live in the country where you want the bank account. Some countries, like Switzerland, allow foreigners to open bank accounts without a permit. However, the banking fees are high for such customers ( > 800$ per year). Unless people have substantial amounts of money ( > 100,000$) the fees will erase their savings. As it happens, many people in Ukraine are not very wealthy. 2. It is difficult. You need to go abroad, speak a foreign language, spend significant amount of time and money. Most don't bother.",

    "output": "Water doesn't freeze from top to bottom. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Freezing Point:** Water freezes at 0°C (32°F). \n2. **Temperature:** The ocean temperature is below freezing at depth.\n3. **Heat Transfer:**  Water at depth doesn't freeze because heat from the surface is not transferred to it. \n4. **Convection:** Heat from the sun is transferred to the ocean surface through convection, a process of rising and sinking air. This heat is not evenly distributed throughout the ocean. \n5. **Convection Currents:**  Convection currents distribute heat throughout the ocean, keeping the water at different temperatures.\n\n**Conclusion:** The ocean's temperature is below freezing at depth due to the lack of heat transfer from the surface, which prevents freezing.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "There are several reasons. The salt in the ocean lowers the temperature needed to make it freeze. Currents stop the ice from bonding, and if Ice did freeze, it is less dense and floats. But the main reason is the pressure, especially in deep water. To freeze, water needs to expand. Deep in the ocean, the pressure from the water stops it from being able to expand.",

    "output": "Two-headed reptiles and Siamese twins share the same body but have two separate brains. \n\n**Brain Function:**\n\n1. **Two distinct brains:** Each twin possesses its own brain, independent of the other. \n2. **Separate sensory input:** Each brain receives sensory information from its corresponding body parts. \n3. **Independent decision-making:** The brains process information independently and make decisions for their respective body parts. \n\n**Body Movement:**\n\n1. **Separate motor control:** Each brain controls its own set of muscles, leading to independent movement of each body part. \n2. **Coordination for complex actions:** While individual actions are controlled by each brain, complex movements like walking or running require coordination between the two brains. \n3. **Communication and integration:**  While the brains are separate, they may communicate and integrate information to coordinate actions in a limited manner. For instance, both twins might move their limbs in unison during a simple task. \n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe two-headed reptile/Siamese twin exhibits a remarkable example of dual-brain organization. However, the brains operate independently, with each brain controlling its own body parts, resulting in separate movements.  Limited coordination exists, particularly for complex actions.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Typically each twin controls a different part of the body. Like the twin girls Brittany and Abigail Hensel. They give the appearance of being one body with two heads, though they have two of each organ above the waist. They have two arms, each controlling one. And from the waist down, they have one body, with each controlling one half. So each controls a leg, for example. There doesn't appear to be any part that both of their brains controls. So they coordinate with each other so that they can walk, but they each have their own body parts they use. In some cases of animals with two heads, only one head \"works\". The other head doesn't seem to have any reactions to stimuli so it's vestigial.",

    "output": "AK-47s are not considered \"accurate\" rifles for the following reasons:\n\n1. **Barrel Length:** AK-47s typically have shorter barrels than military rifles designed for accuracy. A shorter barrel limits the amount of time the bullet has to stabilize in flight.\n\n2. **Recoil:** AK-47s are known for their heavy recoil. This rapid recoil can negatively impact the shooter's ability to maintain accuracy.\n\n3. **Overall Design:** The AK-47's design prioritizes simplicity and reliability over fine-tuning for accuracy. This often leads to a less precise grouping compared to specialized military rifles.\n\n4. **Limited Scope Adjustment:** Many AK-47s lack scope mounts or have limited scope adjustment, making it difficult to achieve precise long-range accuracy.\n\n5. **Limited Accessories:** Compared to military rifles, AK-47s often lack accessories like bipods or adjustable sights, further hindering accuracy.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "1. AK-47's distance between the sight and post is very short which makes it so that for longer ranges, it is extremely difficult to line up an accurate shot as you are more likely to be misaligned with your eye to the sights. 2. It uses a relatively low velocity round, meaning it arcs more and spends more time to get to the target, making it deviate more from environmental conditions 3. Its feeding mechanism uses very large and heavy moving parts which reduces accuracy dramatically from recoil. 4. It has a more significant recoil upon firing due to its type of ammunition, making subsequent rounds less accurate. 5. It operates on a lot looser tolerances, while making it more reliable, also reduces its overall accuracy. 6. [Its gun barrel flexes more than other guns during recoil.](_URL_1_) Compare that with [this](_URL_2_), Or [this](_URL_0_) 7.

Water in aquifers (the stores under the ground that we access when we use wells) and water on Earth's surface are the cheapest to use.

We have also allowed a lot of water to go to the ocean(storm water runoff from developed areas) , rather than slowly go into the aquifers through the ground. So the result is we are using aquifer water faster than they are getting refilled. When that water is depleted, all water will become more expensive. We will still have it, but it will either be salty, polluted, or far from where it needs to be, and all of the fixes for this cost money.

    "output": "Dogs go absolutely crazy after getting a bath because: \n\n1. **Water is cold.** Water is generally unpleasant for dogs, especially when it is cold. \n2. **Water removes scent.** Bath water washes away the dog's natural scent, making them feel less familiar and secure. \n3. **Drying is uncomfortable.**  Dogs struggle to dry off properly, leading to shivering and discomfort. \n4. **Feeling wet and cold.**  The combination of the unpleasant water, uncomfortable drying, and loss of scent can make a dog feel scared, anxious, and overwhelmed. \n5. **Increased sensory input.**  The bath experience exposes the dog to new sights, smells, and sounds, which can be confusing and overwhelming. \n6. **Fear of the unknown.**  The combination of the unpleasant experience and increased sensory input can trigger a fear response in the dog. \n7. **Excitement and relief.**  While the initial fear may subside, the dog may experience a surge of excitement and relief once the bath is over. \n8. **Overwhelming reaction.** This combination of fear, excitement, and relief can lead to the seemingly \"crazy\" behavior. \n9. **Stress and anxiety.** The overall experience of the bath, combined with the discomfort of being wet and cold, can induce stress and anxiety in the dog. This stress response can manifest as a sudden, overwhelming reaction. \n10. **Seeking comfort and security.** The dog may then seek comfort and security in the familiar environment, which may lead to excessive barking, jumping, or other anxious behaviors. \n \nTherefore, the bath experience for dogs is a complex mix of unpleasant sensory input, fear, and stress, which can lead to seemingly \"crazy\" reactions.",

    "Answer": "A bath is a time when dogs get much attention and get touched and scrubbed all over. A dog can become emotionally overwhelmed from this extreme attention.  Also, the situation of getting soaked to the skin is unusual for the dog, perhaps stressful, because their undercoat is an important protection to them. To get this undercoat wet \"against their will\" so to speak, while being restrained, can make them stress. These things can combine to overexcite the dog. To discharge this overexcitement, the dog may go apeshit - running, shaking water off, frenzied actions. In short, blowing off steam.",

The reason this can be (legitimately) different from the actual call is for example a business that has both direct lines to each extension and a main line. An employee calling out would show up with the main line as their caller ID so that if the person calls back they get the main number (this way you’re not giving out the direct number unless you needed to).  The spammers take advantage of this system to spoof a number in the caller ID.  The phone company could counter this by comparing the caller ID info with a number you legitimately own, but they get a lot of money for all these spam calls and they’re not incentivized enough to change how they do things.",

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "\"President\" is a term that is often based on the law of the place where the company is created. For example in the United States, most states require that a corporation have a person with the title President. That title carries with it some legal obligations that tie the individual to the actions of the company. Most jurisdictions don't define or require anyone to hold the title \"Chief Executive Officer\".  Depending on the size of the entity, the President and the CEO may be the same person. Large entities may be comprised of several smaller companies, each with a legally required \"President\", who may report to the CEO at the top of the organizational structure. Some companies may separate the two titles for internal organizational reasons, for historical reasons, or because someone thinks it's clever. It is rare for a company to have a CEO who reports to a President. CEO has become the de facto title for \"the highest level of the executive ladder\", but that's arbitrary and fashion could change.",

Energy in food intake is also measured in this way, though the terms kilocalorie and calorie are often used interchangably, which can cause confusion.  But yes, no matter where it comes from, one calorie always represents the exact same amount of energy. However, a difference you *can* make is that some foods will allow the energy that is within them to be absorbed more efficiently or more quickly, which can lead to varying results.

    "Answer": "**NOT ELI5** The car's driveshaft also powers a *speedometer cable*, which spins a magnet around at the same speed inside the *speed cup*. This magnet rotates continually in an equal direction. This spinning creates a fluctuating magnetic field. The laws of electromagnetism dictate that a current must therefore flow inside this cup. This current causes the speed cup to also rotate. It attempts to catch up with the speed of the magnet. a *hairspring* stops this, so it only rotates a little. This small motion moves the dial on the speedometer a little. The stronger the current, the faster the cup rotates, the further the speedometer's dial moves.  & nbsp; **ELI5** The driveshaft powers a speedometer cable, which leads to a magnet rotating inside a cup. A current is generated, and the cup tries to rotate also. A spring limits this, moving the dial. More current = more speed = dial moves further.",

Sunnis think that leadership in Islam should be by some sort of democratic process, and you don't need to be a descendant of the founder to hold authority. It started out that way when the movement had to decide on how to continue after the death of its founder. Pretty soon, through in-fighting and because that is the way things go in a closely knit community, everybody and his uncle also had an opinion that would be forced upon the community.

    "output": "Film became a synonym for movies because the term \"film\" was used interchangeably to refer to any light-sensitive material that could record an image. This usage predated the development of the movie industry.  \n\n1. **Early Photography:** Photography emerged in the 19th century.\n2. **Photography and Film:** Photography, like early movies, used film. \n3. **Film's Expanding Role:** Film began to be used for a wider range of purposes beyond photography.\n4. **Conciseness:** \"Film\" became a shorthand term for \"moving pictures\" due to its widespread use in the context of the burgeoning movie industry. \n\nTherefore, \"film\" replaced \"movie\" as the common term for moving images, regardless of their origin.",

Slides are an exception, but they didn't get popular until later.  Motion picture film is negative and printed onto another piece of film to make a positive for viewing via a projector. Many people view magnified motion picture film, but most people never view still photo negatives.  This is may not be the etymology, but it makes sense, and that's what your looking for.",

These genes make proteins which help our body work. However, there are occasionally some errors in the genes which ends up making defective/too much/too little proteins which give rise to diseases.  Some of these diseases require 2 faulty set of genes in order to manifest. So if daddy has a defective gene but mommy contributes a normal set, the disease does not manifest clinically (or is milder). If there are many generations of inbreeding, the set of defective genes are kept within the same family tree; there is no new genetic input from a different family and thus the probability of having a child with 2 sets of defective genes increase. This increases the risk of diseases, out of which some may feature a lower IQ/brain malformations.",

They don't require much energy since, again, they stay put; they make their own energy, and it's enough to get by on.  Much of the complexity of animal life revolves around how they tweak the basic mechanics of moving around. Where does it move? How does it move? What does it require in order to move?

    "output": "No. Mobile ads are not intentionally the last thing to load. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **User Experience:** A website should provide a seamless user experience. Loading ads last would disrupt this flow and annoy users.\n2. **Ad Revenue:** Ad revenue is generated from clicks. Placing ads strategically to attract clicks would be counterproductive.\n3. **Ad Quality:** Ads are designed to be visually appealing and relevant to the content. Placing them last would negatively impact their effectiveness. \n4. **Ethical Concerns:** Intentionally causing accidental clicks is unethical and potentially illegal. \n\nTherefore, mobile ads are not intentionally placed last to encourage accidental clicks.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "No. Ads are usually provided by a 3rd party company from their servers, not the same server that is delivering the rest of the content on the page, so they can often take longer to load compared to other stuff on the page.  They are often also image-heavy, which means they take longer to load than text. They are also usually inserted into the page using javascript, so that they can load several different ads to different viewers on the same page, or target ads to different users, or track impressions, & c. The script that loads these ads often runs after other content in the page has loaded, so that the page doesn't have to wait on the ads & just display as blank while the ads load (this would lose you a ton of visitors, & make the ads worthless because there'd be no visitors to see them once they do load).",

However you're not alone in your thinking. Not having a separate comedy category has been a regular criticism of the Oscars. They tried to assuage this a bit (and add some flair and promo to the show) by upping the best picture category from 5 films to up to 10, hopefully to allow more diverse films outside of dramas (such as animated, comedy's, and sci-fi films), but this is still pretty new. They changed the voting on it a bit too, but its unknown if this had any effect on the eventual winners. In other words... this particular award show does its own thing, just like the others, and this does not seem like something they are particularly interested in.",

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Nope, because of the magic of asymmetric cryptography. The short version is that the key used to *encrypt* the data is not the same as the one to *decrypt* it. When Alice sends something to Bob, she encrypts it with his *public* key. This is a key that everyone has the right to see and access. Only Bob, who has the only copy of his *private* key, can then decrypt the message. He then sends a reply, encrypting with Alice's public key, and she decrypts with her private key. The same sort of thing happens with an SSL transaction (HTTPS). When you connect to a secure site, you know you have the right site because they have a certificate proving they are who they say they are. That certificate is also the public key, so you send the data encrypted with that key, and only that site can decrypt it. The site sets up a special session key to encrypt the rest of the data, so you and the site can continue to talk encrypted without anybody else being able to view the contents of the traffic.",

Temperature can be measured in different ways, but they all come down to measuring changes in heat energy (molecular motion and jiggling).  In everyday thermometers, what is measured is how a liquid (originally mercury) expands with temperature, travelling up the bulb. The expansion is due to the atoms in the liquid moving faster and pushing on each other harder.  In devices called thermocouples, the temperature affects how well a piece of metal conducts electricity, which can be measured precisely.  There are also infrared thermometers, which measure the heat energy in the form of light that objects give off. It's important to note that temperature isn't the same thing as energy, but the explanation requires delving into the wonders of thermodynamics, which is a bit too complicated for me to ELI5.",

    "output": "Some doors hit a cushion of air when they close due to the difference in air pressure between the inside and outside of the house. \n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1. **Differential Pressure:** There's a difference in air pressure between the inside of a house and the outside. \n2. **Door Closing:** When a door closes, it seals the space between the house and the outside.\n3. **Air Flow:** This creates a pressure difference. Air inside the house wants to flow out through the open door.\n4. **Air Cushion:** The air pressure difference is slight, causing a gentle \"cushion\" of air to support the door as it closes.\n\n**Why some doors slam:**\n\n* **Insufficient Pressure Difference:** If the air pressure difference between the inside and outside is too small, the door may not seal completely, leading to a forceful closing.\n\n**Why some doors are sucked closed:**\n\n* **Strong Pressure Difference:** If the air pressure difference is very large, the door may be forcefully pushed closed.",

Here's why:\n\n1. **Government bureaucracy:** The government is a complex organization with many departments and agencies. This complexity would lead to inefficiencies in managing an insurance system.\n2. **Cost of administration:**  Managing a large insurance program would require a significant workforce and resources. These costs would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums.\n3. **Risk of mismanagement:** Government agencies can be prone to corruption and mismanagement, leading to poor risk assessment and potentially under-insuring individuals. \n4. **Limited competition:**  A government-run insurance system would likely lack the competition that drives down prices and improves quality in the private sector. \n5. **Potential for price gouging:**  In a government-run system, there is a risk that insurance premiums could be significantly higher than in the private sector, as the government would be seeking revenue rather than profit. \n6. **Lack of innovation:**  For-profit companies have a strong incentive to innovate and develop new products and services to stay competitive. This could lead to a more dynamic insurance market. \n7. **Consumer choice:**  Allowing consumers to choose between private and government-run insurance programs would provide greater individual freedom and control over their healthcare decisions. \n8. **Limited government expertise:** The government may not have the expertise or resources to effectively administer an insurance program. \n \nIn conclusion, private, for-profit insurance companies offer a more efficient, cost-effective, and competitive alternative to a government-run system.",

    "output": "There are two main reasons why financing a car through a bank might be cheaper than financing through the dealership, even if the dealership has lower interest rates:\n\n1. **Dealer markups:** Dealerships often mark up the price of the vehicle by a significant amount, even if it's not their fault. This markup is a profit margin for the dealership. \n2. **Negotiation power:** Banks offer more competitive interest rates and loan terms to attract customers, giving them more negotiating power. This can lead to lower interest rates and better loan terms compared to dealerships.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Quite often, its not. Many times you can combine a rebate with incentivised financing and end up much cheaper than your bank. For example, my wifes 2012 altima is currently financed at 0.5 percent and we bought it several thousand below invoice due to rebates/dealer incentives. No banks/credit unions were anywhere close at the time. The cheapest was around 4% at the time. Where dealerships get you is with all of the add-ons like extended warranties, window etching, undercoats, etc and you will get offered those regardless of whose financing you use.",

    "Answer": "It's probably a combination of reasons. Humans like to be awake all day and sleep all night. And we take our cues from the sun. If it's raining it's darker, so our bodies think, hey almost time for bed! Let's get sleepy! The other reason is ( I'm not to sure about this one so other redditors feel free to debunk me! ): When we're in our mommy's belly we're constantly surrounded by the sound of her body, her digestive system gurgling but mostly the sound of her blood circulating. Which is a constant rushing sound. Rain kinda sounds like that, just like a rolling car, or vacuum cleaner. This makes us feel safe and comfortable. And again sleepy. Fun facts about this: If you drive a long way and don't have any distracting sounds like a radio the sound of your car can cause 'highway hypnosis' causing you to relax and fall asleep behind the wheel. Babies, when they're tired fall alseep very easily in the car or when a vacuum cleaner is running. Because it reminds them of being inside mommy's belly.",

The moving pattern is constant, so they are firing continuously. When you look away those same cells continue to fire because they've been doing so for however long you were looking at it. Your brain knows that the moving pattern is no longer in focus, but it still takes a bit to inhibit the neurons and stop them from firing. It's why optical illusions [like this one](_URL_1_) work.",

If it does then that means the star is partially obscured by a planet transiting across the front of it.  We do not have that perspective on planets beyond the orbit of earth as there is nothing bright for them to obscure. We cannot see them with telescopes because they are too dark and/or distant to detect, the best we can do is look for slight changes in the orbit of objects we can see (such as Pluto) to see if they are being affected by the gravity of something unknown.",

Now container A has 90.91 units of liquid A, and 9.09 units of B. However, container B still has the same proportion of liquid A and B after the first mixing - namely, 10/110 liquid A, and 100/110 liquid B.

    "output": "Electrical grounding for ships is complicated because it involves a complex system of interconnected components designed to safely handle high voltages and currents. \n\n**Step 1: Identifying the Issue**\n\nShips carry large amounts of electrical power, often exceeding 1000 volts. This voltage can pose a serious risk of electrocution if a person comes into contact with live electrical equipment.\n\n**Step 2: The Grounding System**\n\nThe grounding system serves two main purposes:\n\n* **Protection:**  It prevents electrical currents from flowing through the body of the ship and into the sea.\n* **Safety:** It provides a safe path for electrical currents to flow in case of a fault.\n\n**Step 3: Components of the Grounding System**\n\n* **Neutral Wire:** This wire connects all electrical equipment to the grounding system.\n* **Grounding Electrode System (GES):** This system consists of:\n    * **Metallic Bonding:**  Metal parts of the ship, like the hull, are connected together to create a low-resistance path for current flow.\n    * **Grounding Electrode:** This is typically a metal object on the ship, like a steel pipe, which serves as the final point of contact with the sea.\n* **Grounding Electrodes:** These are metal parts on the ship that connect to the grounding electrode system.\n\n**Step 4: The Process**\n\n1. **Normal Operation:** When electrical equipment is powered on, the neutral wire carries the electrical current to the grounding electrode system.\n2. **Fault Occurs:** If a fault occurs in the equipment or wiring, the current will flow through the grounding electrode system.\n3. **Protection:**  This flow of current through the grounding system provides a path for the fault current to be safely diverted to the sea, preventing electrocution.\n4. **Safety:** This also ensures that the electrical system remains in a safe state, preventing further damage or hazards.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe grounding system for ships is complicated because it involves a complex network of interconnected components designed to provide a safe path for electrical currents in case of a fault.

    "output": "People with colorblindness have difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Genetics:** Colorblindness is primarily caused by inherited gene mutations. \n2. **Light Sensitivity:** These mutations affect the cells in the eye responsible for detecting color. These cells have photoreceptor cells (cones).\n3. **Cone Function:** Cones are specialized cells that respond to different wavelengths of light.  \n4. **Color Perception:** When light hits the cones, they send signals to the brain. \n5. **Color Detection:**  The brain interprets these signals as the perception of color. \n6. **Colorblindness:**  If the cones are malfunctioning (due to the gene mutation), the brain receives signals that are not interpreted as colors. \n\nTherefore, people with colorblindness have difficulty processing color information due to malfunctions in the light-sensitive cones in their eyes.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Inside your eye are 3 different kinds of cells for detecting colors, one can see red, one can see green, and one can see blue. In colorblind individuals, one of those is either missing or not functioning properly, and so the number of combinations of colors you can distinguish is drastically lowered. You can still tell most colors apart because even if you may not see green properly, you'll detect the varying shades of red and blue in that color but you're missing some of the information.",

    "Answer": "Raindrops form when water vapour in the atmosphere clusters around microscopic solid particles (such as dust) in a process called nucleation. Nucleation is reversible. As water molecules attach themselves to cluster, other molecules are leaving. There is a point called the *critical nuclear size*, at which point the cluster of water molecules is stable. This is the point at which a raindrop forms. The critical nuclear size /critical radius is controlled by temperature. The mathematics tells us that as the temperature is lowered, the critical radius decreases. Hopefully this answers your first question, and if I'm wrong I'd very much like to be called out on it!

It's about allowing the internal juices to redistribute. \n\n1. **Searing:** High heat sears the surface of the steak, creating a crust.\n2. **Moisture Loss:**  This searing process causes the surface meat to dry out.\n3. ** redistribute Juices:** Resting allows these juices to flow towards the center of the steak. \n4. **Even Cooking:** This even distribution ensures the steak cooks through without drying out. \n5. **Enhanced Flavor:**  The distributed juices contribute to a more flavorful and tender steak.",

    "Answer": "You just need to let it rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting into it. When you cut it right away after removing from heat, you will notice the plate will fill with liquid. That liquid is full of flavor that the steak loses.",

    "Answer": "It is calculated by measuring the rates of breakdown under less than ideal storage conditions. With ice cream, the limiting factor is likely to be the time it takes for ice crystals to grow, as well as the oxidation of some fats, degrading the taste and texture of the product. Because of this, it is likely to be called a 'Best Before' than an 'Expiry' date. All of this is very complex, but is reduced to a certain number of days, from which is subtracted a safety margin, again carefully calculated. This is added to the date of production to give an expiry date.  If it has been in your properly functioning freezer, and is a few days over, then chow down and enjoy.",

This damage can disrupt gene function and lead to mutations.\n2. **Telomere shortening:** Telomeres are protective caps on the ends of chromosomes.  Each time a cell divides, telomeres shorten.  Eventually, telomeres become too short to allow for proper DNA replication, leading to cell death.\n3. **Loss of telomerase activity:**  Telomerase is an enzyme that lengthens telomeres.  As cells age, telomerase activity declines, further contributing to telomere shortening.\n4. **Metabolic changes:** Cells become less efficient at processing and recycling waste products, leading to accumulation of cellular debris and damage.\n5. **Loss of tissue function:**  Cells lose the ability to perform their specific functions over time, leading to age-related decline in organs and tissues.",

    "Answer": "> many games available on standard cable packages like college? Because they make more money the way it is currently setup. It's pretty simple at that. They have limited games on broadcast TV which they charge crazy rates for, which in turn is a limited amount of games people can watch which means everyone is watching them and the networks can charge crazy rates for ads. The NFL then sells exclusive access to Sunday Ticket to DirecTV for a giant rate (DirecTV paid way too much) to make even more money. The NFL is unarguably the best league in the world of sports at crafting and learning how to extract maximum value from their TV rights. Other leagues like the English Premier League, UEFA, NBA and such are all learning from the NFL's examples on how to craft TV deals, the NFL is just the best at it.",

Every day you will earn $5 and at the end of the day you will have $0 left, and so the cycle repeats until you die. But if you earn $6, you can put away some of that money. You can save $1 a day and put it in a bank account. You can set the money to work, *to make you more money*. For the super-rich, this is even more extreme. The more money you make, the more you can invest, and the more you make off of those investments that you can then re-invest. It's a positive feedback loop.",

    "output": "The satisfying sensation of popping things comes from a combination of sensory and motor feedback:\n\n1. **Mechanical Feedback:** The act of popping something creates a distinct sound and physical sensation. This feedback provides immediate, quantifiable information about the object's state. \n2. **Sensory Processing:** The brain processes this sensory information, associating it with the act of popping.\n3. **Motor Feedback:**  The act of popping itself engages muscles and joints, providing a sense of physical exertion and accomplishment. This feedback reinforces the association between the action and the satisfaction.\n4. **Reward:**  The combination of satisfying sound and physical feedback triggers the brain's reward system. This reinforces the behavior, making it more likely to be repeated in the future. \n5. **Evolutionary Advantage:**  This process aligns with our evolutionary history.  The act of popping was likely a useful behavior for manipulating food and removing obstacles, providing a sense of accomplishment and access to resources. \n \nTherefore, the satisfaction we get from popping things is a result of a combination of sensory, motor, and reward mechanisms, all linked to our evolutionary history.",

    "Answer": "If you want the actual explanation for why some people say this, it is the following: People *claim* that it isn't actually racism because racism = prejudice + power. So if you are a historically disadvantaged group (therefore less power), nothing you do can be racist. It can be bigoted, intolerant, or ignorant - but not *racist*.  Does it make much sense? No, I don't think so. If you want equality, practice equality. Pretty simple. But that is how people try to justify it, anyway. You also have a non-trivial amount of people who just hear \"blacks can't be racist\" (or whatever group you want to use) and go around using that to justify obviously racist/sexist actions without understanding the \"justification\" at all.",

Flash storage does not contain moving parts but rather is similar to a large grid of capacitors and transistors that are used to keep data. It is faster to access than an HDD because you do not need to wait for the disk to spin to the correct location. It can decay, however, unlike an HDD.

Conditioning is where a non-typical object, body part, or act is associated with sex by pairing it with typical erotic stimulation, either visual, audio, or physical. So for example someone could develop a sexual fetish for women in boots by watching porn where women are wearing boots, or just by touching themselves in an arousing way while looking at the boots themselves. Psychological Development suggests that the roots for sexual fetishes often develop during childhood. It can arise from things such as social taboos, if it's forbidden or frowned upon to show a specific body part (such as calves) then maybe seeing a naked calf when you hit puberty could be considered arousing.",

    "Answer": "Ebola has no cure, or even a real treatment. It never really went away. It's just that humans aren't commonly exposed to it (it probably normally lives in bats), and when they are it tends to kill quickly enough that it burns itself out. So you see a series of fairly quick and nasty outbreaks in the areas in which infected bat populations come in contact with humans, in west and central Africa.  Plague is different, in that it's curable with antibiotics. It lives in various rodents, and occasionally breaks out because it too has never really gone away. If it happens in a richer country, it's usually dealt with pretty easily. Isolated cases pop up in the US and Canada now and again, incidentally.",

However, the Tsar's unwillingness to compromise further fueled the anger of the people, leading to the March Revolution.\n5. **February Revolution:** The Tsar's continued refusal to accept the peace terms resulted in widespread protests and ultimately the Tsar's abdication in April 1917. \n6. **Establishment of the Provisional Government:** The Tsar's abdication led to the establishment of a Provisional Government, which faced the challenge of maintaining order and addressing the country's complex problems in the midst of war. \n7. **Rise of the Bolsheviks:** The Provisional Government struggled to gain popular support.

    "Answer": "The Russian Revolution is actually two revolutions, the February revolution and the October revolution (Stalin, btw, was involved in neither). During World War 1, in February 1917, a bunch of workers in Russia started a strike, and basically everybody ended up joining it, including the army and eventually some key figures of the Czar's government. They forced the Czar to step down and give power to the Provisional Government, that was supposed to organize free elections, but ended up being removed from power in November by a group of Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin and Trotsky. The basic reasons were that the Russians were losing WW1, and that there was a lot of poverty and hunger. Also, the Czar was very unpopular because he taxed heavily and was very dictatorial. It turned out that the Provisional Government really didn't do that much better, so that gave Lenin the chance he took to get some support for this second revolution.",

The donor and recipient would have to be right by each other. 2. The retina is part of the brain, so if a donor is brain dead, the eye would be dead too. You have to harvest the eye right after the donor's heart stops. 3. You have to connect the optic nerve, which has 1.3 million individual nerves that need to link up. 4. You need to suppress the immune system so it doesn't recognize the new eye as a foreign and attack it. (Although this isn't as bad as for other organs since the eye is generally protected from the immune system.) Actually this stuff isn't that far off.

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "You're correct that white and black would provide the greatest contrast, but the primary issue isn't contrast. Highway signs are \"retroreflective,\" meaning that at night, when you shine your headlights on them, the light not only illuminates the sign, but the sign also directly reflects a good amount of that light back at you. Black backgrounds would not be efficient retroreflectors (since black absorbs most light, reducing reflectivity), plus they would be difficult to see at night since the sky is black. Green was chosen since the eye is highly sensitive to green, it is clearly visible day and night, and it is a good retroreflector. Green is a common choice in many countries, including Canada, Japan, China, and Australia. Many European countries opt for blue backgrounds with white text or white backgrounds with black text.",

This stream of water has more mass than you'd think, because water is quite heavy, and it has a momentum (m • v). All this momentum goes into the boat, because momentum is conserved (the old physics rule \"Every action has an equal and opposite reaction\") so since the boat has a larger mass it gets a smaller increase in velocity.

Our research groups use their models on our supercomputers to research solar energy, advanced films, water treatment, artificial intelligence, medical imaging, and a lot more. All of this requires a lot of processing power because 1, these are complex models involving the interactions between multiple dimensions of variables; 2, because being able to perform calculations faster means either getting results sooner, or being able to simulate systems in more detail, with better results.",

    "output": "Italy and Germany viewed their World War II involvement differently due to the **fundamental difference in their wartime objectives**. \n\n1. **Germany's goal:** Germany sought to **dominate Europe** and **expand its territory** through military conquest.\n2. **Italy's goal:** Italy's primary objective was **territorial gain** and **economic prosperity** from the war. \n3. **The alliance:** Italy joined the Axis powers for these strategic reasons, while Germany sought to achieve these goals through military conquest. \n\nTherefore, the differing motivations for Italy and Germany's wartime involvement led to contrasting historical perspectives on their collaboration in World War II.",

    "Answer": "Because at one point during the war (1943) the Italian King had Mussolini arrested and at this point Italy was not part of the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan) anymore. Germany, from an ally became an invading force of Italy. Also, the anti-Jewish laws were repealed by the new Badoglio government while the war was still going on.  Basically, by the end of the war, Italy was not viewed as one of the 'bad guys' anymore. So while for Germany there were the [Nuremberg trials](_URL_0_), where all the atrocities committed by Germany came into surface, no such trial took place against Italy.  So it's a combination of two things: a. Italy probably didn't commit atrocities comparable to Germany; b. any war crimes Italy did commit did not undergo the same level of inquiry of those commited by Germany.",

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "In the case of fireflies (I don't know if it is representative for all organisms) it's an enzyme called \"luciferin\" that undergoes a chain of reaction that emits light. It first reacts with ATP, the basic energy provider to almost all processes in our body, turning into \"luciferyl adenylate\". This in turn can react with Oxygen, turning into \"oxyluciferin\". The interesting thing about this reaction is that it produces oxyluciferin in an excited state. That means that one of its electrons has more energy than usual and is moving at a higher speed further away from the molecule than in it's basic, unexcited form. The electron will eventually \"fall down\" from this high energy state, \"dumping\" the energy difference in form of a photon of a certain color corresponding to the energy difference. This is the basic mechanism that produces the light of most light sources besides incadescent.",

Body soap is a soap designed for your skin. It gets dirt off your skin. You can't just wash dirt and grease off with water because water and oil don't mix. Soap is an \"emulsifier\" it means that it makes it so water can wash away oil. 2-in-1 is conditioner and shampoo mixed together. So you only have to use one product to wash your hair. There's a lot of rumors that it's bad for your hair. From what I've learned, if you have very fine hair then it's better to not use a 2 in 1.

Generally everyone senses the same things the same way, from vision to taste, excluding those with sensory deprivations (colorblindness, deafness, etc.).  Perceiving is a different story. It's all in your head. We attach meaning to different sensations. Like when you see your SO and get happy if you're in a great relationship. Basically you attach meaning to different sounds you hear. People tend to like major keys that are consonant, but of course not all because different people attach different meanings based on their experiences!

    "output": "1. **Basements/cellars are often damp and humid.** This is because they are typically below ground level, receiving less sunlight and experiencing higher humidity. \n2. **Mold and mildew thrive in damp, humid environments.** They are microscopic organisms that feed on organic matter, such as dust, debris, and even wood. \n3. **Basements/cellars provide a perfect environment for mold and mildew to grow.** This is because the damp, humid conditions allow them to flourish. \n4. **Therefore, basements/cellars tend to attract mold and mildew.**",

    "Answer": "A cellar is usually colder then the outside as it is kept dark and surrounded by cold dirt. Humidity is based on not only the amount of water in the air but also the temperature of the air. So when air gets down into the basement and gets cooled down its humidity increases. All life needs water to thrive. Basements with a lot of humidity will have a lot more humidity so it is easier for mold to get the water it needs.",

    "output": "Yes. \n\n1. **Flu viruses:** Flu viruses can mutate, leading to different strains (e.g., influenza A, influenza B). \n2. **Bacterial infections:** Some bacterial infections can co-occur with viral infections. \n3. **Simultaneous infections:** Therefore, it is possible to have both a viral and bacterial infection at the same time.",

The term \"bacterial flu\" is misleading because it means a bacterial infection occurring because your immune system has been weakened by the flu virus. So you can't have bacterial flu without having \"actual\" influenza caused by the influenza virus. So your answer is in your question. You can only have what is confusingly described as \"bacterial flu\" if you have viral flu. If you're using the word \"flu\" to describe any illness with similar symptoms then yes, you can definitely have as many infections as you would care to pick up. It will eventually kill you. Immune disorders (like AIDS) are such a problem because you end up with every disease and infection out there and it becomes impossible to stop the sufferer getting sick and dying from any and all kinds of infections.",

    "output": "Tinfoil's heat resistance stems from its unique chemical composition and structure.\n\n1. **Aluminum's high melting point:** Aluminum has a melting point of 1210 degrees Celsius, far higher than most metals. This means it takes significant heat to melt the metal.\n\n2. **Reflective surface:** The aluminum coating on tinfoil is highly reflective. This prevents heat transfer through convection, the process of heat transfer by the movement of hot air.\n\n3. **Low thermal conductivity:** Aluminum has a low thermal conductivity, meaning it resists the flow of heat energy. This further minimizes heat transfer from the underlying foil.\n\n4. **Protective barrier:** The thin aluminum foil acts as a barrier, preventing direct contact between the hot surface and the underlying foil. This minimizes heat transfer through conduction and convection.\n\nIn summary, the combination of high melting point, reflective surface, low thermal conductivity, and protective barrier makes tinfoil highly resistant to heat.",

However, here's a step-by-step reasoning process:\n\n1. **Tears are a physiological response:** Tears are produced by glands in the eyes and serve to lubricate and protect the surface of the eye. \n2. **Sadness is a complex emotion:** Sadness is a multifaceted emotional experience with physiological and psychological components.\n3. **Emotional distress and the sympathetic nervous system:** During emotional distress, the sympathetic nervous system (responsible for the \"fight-or-flight\" response) is activated. This triggers a cascade of physiological changes, including increased tear production.\n4. **Physiological link to sadness:** While tears have other functions, their increased production during emotional distress, particularly sadness, may contribute to the perceived link.\n\nTherefore, the association between tears and sadness likely stems from a combination of physiological changes triggered by emotional distress and the perception of tears as a sign of sadness. \n\n**It's important to note:** The association is not absolute and may vary across individuals and cultures.",

For Example, if you put 2 heavy balls on a trampoline, they warp the trampoline and move towards each other. This is just an analogy, but it helps give you the idea. This warping of space-time has some other side affects, which allows General Relativity to predict and explain thing that Newton's law doesn't (like small changes in the orbit of planets, light bending around stars, and clocks in GPS satellites running slower).",

The water, having just washed down from the hillsides, was very muddy, and so the ballast is caked in mud. And so right now the line is closed for a couple of weeks while they clean the ballast. This is because the mud is preventing the water from draining away properly.

    "output": "The term \"better looking\" is subjective and lacks objective criteria. \n\nNuclear weapons create mushroom clouds due to the rapid release of energy and the associated chemical reactions. \n\n1. **Nuclear fission:** The explosion releases enormous amounts of energy.\n2. **Superheated gases:** This energy rapidly heats the surrounding air.\n3. **Rapid expansion:** The hot gases expand explosively, creating a large volume of hot air.\n4. **Thermal expansion:** This hot air expands rapidly, forming a large, visible cloud.\n\nWhile the mushroom cloud appears visually appealing, it is a result of destructive force, not aesthetic preference.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Primarily scale. On a smaller explosive, the cloud will be, well, smaller. You'll be able to see all the little imperfections around its edges, and those imperfections will take up a larger proportionate area of the total structure. In a nuclear cloud, it's just so big that you don't notice the same-sized imperfection in the mushroom shape as much.",

    "Answer": "I suggest that you read a few button tutorials for embedded systems like arduino or raspberry pi. The processor can read the state of the buttons at any time. So they do this in a loop. When they notice the button is pressed they start a timer and wait for the button to be released. By measuring the time it takes for you to release the button they can do different functions. To save on battery they might not do it in a loop but rather have an interrupt logic in place that will signal the CPU whenever the state of a button changes and make it run the button checking logic. There may also be additional logic on the circuit board that detects if the power button have been held down for some time without the CPU reacting and do certain functions like toggling the power. This can be useful if the CPU have crashed or if the device is out of power.",

    "Answer": "Everybody has bad genes in them - I remember a scientist quipping that there are enough genetic defects in the human genome to kill a person several times over. However, all humans get two sets of genes, one from each parent. As a result, many of the 'defects' you might have in your genes are simply overridden by the working copy you got from your other parent. However, when you inbreed, you've got two people with very similar genetics, which means that its more likely that they'll both have identical copies of a defective gene (or gene set). That means the offspring is more likely to receive both copies of the defect from their parents, losing that protection that normally came from receiving two sets of chromosomes. Do not that inbreeding doesn't increase rates of mutations, just the likelihood of genetic defects that are already existing in the parents being expressed fully. Also, this question gets asked a lot. Use the search bar next time.",

Usually things that cause fluctuations in gravity move too slowly to tell, but large, violent events cause waves: fluctuations in the gravitational field. These were predicted a century ago but it took these guys and a clever experiment to finally observe one.  Classic Newtonian understanding of gravity was that it would propagate infinitely: if you could instantly remove an object, the lack of gravity from it would be immediately felt. This experiment shows that it propagates at the speed of light, and radiates out like light or other forces.",

    "output": "It is **not possible** to know precise details about planets that are many lightyears away.\n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n1. **Vast distances:** Light travels at a finite speed.

Planets far away have traveled for many years, even centuries.\n2. **Limited information:**  We can observe planets based on their light and gravitational effects. This information is limited and can only provide a range of sizes. \n3. **Resolution limitations:**  Current telescopes and observation techniques have resolution limits that restrict our ability to determine exact sizes of planets at great distances.\n\nTherefore, knowing the exact size of Pluto requires observations of it in a closer orbit, which is not currently feasible.",

In 1960, President-Elect Kennedy attended his inaguration hatless and thereafter fashion changed rapidly to dispense with headgear except as environmental conditions required. From about 1920 to 1960 men found it increasingly hard to use hats as an article of fashion due to the headroom in cars. As the headroom got smaller, hats got harder to wear. First the large tophat style hats vanished, then even smaller fedoras. About the only place men still feel comfortable wearing headgear in transport is in the cab of large trucks.",

    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "First, texture has a lot to do with food. The sensations of chewing, moving food around in your mouth, and taking a bite-sized solid piece of omelet versus a fluffy bit of scrambled egg with a lot of air in it will add to a difference in flavor. Next, your omelet usually has a big chunk of \"other stuff\" in its middle whereas the scrambled egg approach would have little bits of other things all throughout them (assuming you are making them with more than just cheese). This changes the way those additional bits cook and exchange tastes with each other, changes their moisture content, and changes the distribution of flavours that you get in each mouthful. Finally, scrambled eggs are mixed around and they're cooked very uniformly without a \"browned\" exterior, but omelets usually have a little more deep-cooking in their exterior surface, and its different more-burned chemicals can result in a different flavor profile.",

    "output": "Light transfers data in optical fibers through **total internal reflection**. \n\n1. **Light enters the fiber:** Light from a source is incident on the fiber's surface.\n2. **Total Internal Reflection:** The light encounters the fiber's core, where the refractive index is higher than the surrounding cladding. This causes the light to be reflected back into the core.\n3. **Reflection within the core:** The reflected light undergoes multiple reflections within the core, repeatedly bouncing back towards the cladding.\n4. **Radiation pressure:** The light eventually escapes the fiber through the cladding, carrying the data signal with it. \n5. **Signal propagation:** The signal travels down the fiber guided by total internal reflection, without scattering or losing power.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "When data is transmitted over a wire, the wire is turned on and off very quickly. Thousands of times per second, it checks if the wire is currently on. If the signal is off, that is interpreted as a 0. If it's on, that's a 1. Light travels through fiber optic cables.

    "output": "Everyone can launch a satellite. There are no laws claiming space territory. \n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **International Space Law:** The Outer Space Treaty of 1967 establishes the principle of peaceful use of space. This treaty does not grant any nation ownership or control of space.\n2. **Launch Vehicles:** Launch vehicles, regardless of origin or ownership, are typically purchased and operated by private companies or government agencies. \n3. **Launch Authorization:** While there are no legal requirements to launch a satellite, launching a satellite often requires authorization from relevant government agencies. This is for safety, environmental reasons, and potential legal liabilities. \n4. **National Security Concerns:**  Some nations may restrict satellite launches for national security reasons. However, these restrictions are not universally enforced. \n \nTherefore, anyone with the resources and authorization can launch a satellite.",

A silencer basically extends the barrel and helps that \"explosion air\" diffuse in other directions so that the resulting explosion from the gunshot is much quieter.

You exhale through your mouth because it's a bigger opening and you want to get the 'bad air' out as fast as you can.  Your nose also helps regulate the temperature of the air you're breathing. When it goes in your mouth it goes very quickly into your lungs, and if it's too cold it can be jarring to your lungs.

    "output": "There is no single answer to why a viable third party hasn't emerged in American politics. It's a complex issue with multiple contributing factors. \n\nHere's a breakdown of potential reasons:\n\n1. **Two-Party System:** The US political system is deeply entrenched in a two-party system, with Democrats and Republicans holding significant power and influence.  Third parties struggle to gain traction, as they face an uphill battle against established parties.\n\n2. **Electoral System:** The US electoral system, particularly the Electoral College, makes it difficult for third parties to win presidential elections. A candidate needs a majority of electoral votes, which can be challenging with smaller party support.\n\n3. **Funding and Resources:** Third parties often lack the financial resources and organizational capacity to compete effectively with the two major parties. \n\n4. **Voter Turnout:** Third parties struggle to attract enough voter turnout to gain a majority in presidential elections.  \n\n5. **Lack of Clear Identity and Platform:** Many third parties lack a clear identity and cohesive platform, making it difficult for voters to identify with their message. \n\n6. **Political Climate:** The current political climate in the US is often characterized by polarization and division.  This can make it difficult for third parties to gain traction and appeal to a broad base of voters.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",

Whoever gets the most votes wins, rather than the candidate having to secure a simple majority of 50% plus one. Third parties end up skewing the results and acting as \"spoilers\". There have been successful third parties — the Republican Party, for one. There's also the matter of the two main parties doing everything they can to keep viable third party candidates off the ballot or handicapped in one way or another. Ranked choice voting is one solution to this rather undemocratic feature of our system.",

    "output": "## Blood Type:\n\nBlood type is a classification based on the presence or absence of specific antigens (proteins) on the surface of red blood cells. \n\n**Key Antigens:**\n\n* **ABO system:**  \n    * **A:**  Presence of A antigen\n    * **B:** Presence of B antigen\n    * **AB:** Presence of both A and B antigens\n    * **O:** Absence of A and B antigens\n\n* **Rh factor:**  Presence or absence of the Rh antigen.\n\n## Why is our blood different?\n\nThe variation in blood types arises from the genetic inheritance of these antigens. Each individual inherits two alleles (versions of a gene) for each blood type antigen from their parents. These alleles determine the presence or absence of the corresponding antigen on red blood cells. \n\n**Example:**\n\n* Someone with the genotype **AA** will have blood type **A**.\n* Someone with the genotype **AO** will have blood type **O**.\n\nTherefore, the combination of alleles inherited from both parents determines the final blood type.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Not quite 5, but I'll give it a shot. Blood type refers to the type of cell marker that exists on the outside of your red blood cells. There are 3 types- A, B, and O. If you have A, B is considered foreign so you will have anti-B antibodies. The same can be said for A if you have B type blood.  If you have O, it is neither A nor B so you make antibodies for both A and B.  AB blood types have no antibodies since both types are present on their cells.  Type ABs are referred to as \"universal recipients\" because they have no antibodies in their blood and can therefore receive any type of blood without fear of the body rejecting it. Type Os are the universal donors under most condition but this can vary depending on other more complicated factors since as I mentioned before they have anti-A and anti-B antibodies. These types are genetic. A and B are dominant to O, and if you get an A from one parent and a B from another, you will be AB (co-dominant).",

The pronunciation is also different, but that probably won't matter in your class. Most people I've spoken to have said they found Mediaeval Latin 'easier' than Classical Latin. And the subject matter is often more church-focused, so you'll run into lots of new ecclesiastical vocabulary often borrowed from Greek (eg episcopus for bishop, angelus for angel/messenger (of God)), or new meanings for old words (eg Dominus for the Lord, God, rather than the head of a household)",

    "Answer": "People commenting here don't know what they're talking about. Birds do get fat the closer you get to the cold extremes (arctic, mountain peaks). You've never seen one because, I assume, you haven't been to these types of places. Furthermore, you wouldn't know how fat the bird is until you kill and butcher it, but I promise, there are fat birds. Yes, flight is a big part of their survival, but so is fat in the cold weather. As with most things, there's a balance. When colder season come, birds store fat. Not enough that they cannot fly anymore, but they do store fat. When it's time to migrate, a lot of that fat gets burned off.",

    "output": "There is no specific amount or frequency that marks under-the-table bank deposits as suspicious. \n\n**Reasoning:**\n\n* **Suspicious behavior is relative:** What is suspicious depends on the context.  A small, infrequent deposit might be normal for one person, but concerning for another.\n* **Risk assessment is key:** Financial institutions use risk assessment models to identify suspicious activity.  These models consider factors like the depositor's financial history, industry, and potential motives.\n* **No set threshold:** There is no universal amount or frequency that triggers suspicion. \n\n**Conclusion:**  The value of the deposit itself is not the defining factor.

    "Answer": "Men didn't prefer virgins because they got to be the first. It was about legacy. Everything they had and were would be passed on to a son, and they wanted to make sure that boy really was his son.  Marrying a virgin helped ensure this. Not only could the husband be sure she was not pregnant with another man's child, but she had followed the norm of society, and could be expected to continue to do so when married. Conversely, a woman known to have had sex out of marriage defied society, was considered a harlot who could not be trusted to remain faithful. In this scheme, a widow is almost as good as a virgin. She followed the rules and just had an unlucky break, so there was no reason to believe she would be any less faithful. Also, widows often inherited their husband's property and were more wealthy than a young woman still living with her family.",

What is leftover from however they produce income is what is provided to their charity or organization.  As far as getting paid for odd jobs, that usually falls under the consultant category. Basically a company or individual seeks the advice of someone who specializes in a certain field or area. The most popular example would be something like website design where big companies can have an inhouse team, but small companies or non-profits, will contract someone to create their site... in which case the one time cost is significantly cheaper than a full time employee.  But there are people who specialize in some weird stuff and their specialty is sometimes needed.

In other words, the price of oil is determined in much the same way the price of a stock is determined, not like the price of a good/service is determined. OPEC decided not to cut production (Saudi Arabia especially), which had the effect of driving prices down (supply/demand imbalance), but they do not actually decide what price they will be able to sell a barrel of oil.",

    "output": "The phrase \"Purchase Not Necessary\" is used in promotions to emphasize that the offer is **not a requirement** for purchase. \n\nThis is done to:\n\n1. **Avoid pressure:** By stating it's not necessary, the promotion avoids making customers feel obligated to buy.\n2. **Maintain a sense of value:** The offer is presented as a bonus or incentive, not as a necessity. \n3. **Avoid negative perception:**  Using the phrase can help the promotion appear more generous and less coercive.",

    "output": "The exact reason for cannabis illegality is complex, but here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Growing Societal Concerns:** In the early 20th century, there was increasing anxiety about drug use, particularly among youth. This anxiety was amplified by the perceived threat of cannabis, which was seen as a gateway drug to harder substances.\n\n2. **Political Leverage:**  Cannabis was a readily available, often illicit, commodity. This made it politically convenient to demonize.  \n\n3. **The Marijuana Tax Act (1937):** This act, while not outright illegalizing cannabis, placed significant taxes on its production and sale. This effectively made it difficult to legally produce and sell cannabis.\n\n4. **The Marihuana Tax Act of 1970:** This act further restricted cannabis production, sales, and distribution. It classified cannabis as a Schedule I drug, meaning it was deemed to have no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.\n\n5. **The Controlled Substances Act of 1970:** This act further classified cannabis as a Schedule I drug, solidifying its illegal status.\n\n**In essence, cannabis became illegal due to a confluence of factors: growing societal anxieties about drug use, political leverage, and the implementation of restrictive legislation that made the cannabis trade difficult and costly.**",

Also, think about how babies get nappy rash from having wet nappies against their butts for extended periods, if you have wet soppy faeces (like swamp ass) because you couldn't clean it all properly it's going to start itching and irritating you.",

    "output": "Hanging highly irradiated patient's limbs up in the air does **not** have a practical purpose. \n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Irradiation damages tissues.**  Radiation causes cellular damage and death. \n2. **Limbs are not typically exposed to high levels of radiation.**  Radiation therapy focuses on specific areas of the body. \n3. **Hanging limbs in the air would not provide any benefit.**  There's no scientific or medical justification for this practice. \n\nTherefore, hanging irradiated patient limbs in the air is not a standard medical procedure and serves no purpose.",

    "Answer": "Not a scientifically backed explanation as such but it might be to do with minimizing contact with surfaces to reduce the pain the subject is in. Any sort of second degree burn or worse hurts when it has pressure applied.",

    "output": "The melody on a vinyl record is encoded as a series of tiny grooves cut into the black vinyl. These grooves are physically small and vary in depth (amplitude) and width (frequency) to represent the musical information. \n\nThe record player reads these grooves and uses them to control the movement of a needle ( stylus) that vibrates the needle's tip back and forth. This vibration is converted into an electrical signal, which is then amplified and sent to speakers to reproduce the sound.",
    "model_id": "google/t5gemma-xl-xl-prefixlm-it",
    "Answer": "Such is the genius of Thomas Edison. It turns out sound waves are really pressure waves that exert force on your eardrums 'creating' sound. Vinyl is a soft material which is sensitive to subtle changes in force. Therefore to make a recording, an etching needle is placed on the vinyl and when sounds are made it moves the needle up and down according to the pressure exerted by the sound wave. As a result it literally converts a pressure wave into a physical shape. To play back, the opposite occurs. You run a needle over the record and the needle moves a diaphragm back and forth converting the 'shape' of the sound wave back into an actual sound.",

    "Answer": "Let's put it this way - you can't divide something into zero parts. You can divide it into one part, but not zero parts. That's an illogical question (what happens if you divide $10 in zero parts?) There's no answer. Here: $0 x 12 months = I'll give you $0 every month for 12 months. How much money will you have after a year? $0. $12 x 0 months = I'll give you $12 every month, but no months have occurred yet. How much money do you have? $0. $0/12 months = You've made $0 in a year - how much did you make monthly? $0 $12/0 months = You've made $12 in the span of no time at all. How much money did you make monthly? Um...well...I didn't make money monthly. There's no way to calculate this, because there's no time on the scale.",

    "output": "Before diapers, children were cared for using various methods depending on the time period and location. \n\n**Step 1: Define time period.** \n\n* The question doesn't specify a timeframe. We'll assume pre-modern times (roughly 15th century onwards).\n\n**Step 2: Describe common practices.**\n\n* **Skin-to-skin contact:** Children were often held close to the parent's body for warmth and comfort.\n* **Bare bottoms:** Children were not covered with any material. This provided natural ventilation and absorbency. \n* **Potty training:**  This was a gradual process, often involving trial and error.  \n* **Lining:**  Some families used coverings made from fabric or animal skin to protect the child from the elements.\n\n**Step 3: Summarize.**\n\nChild rearing before diapers involved a combination of physical contact, skin exposure, and a lack of absorbent protection.",

    "Answer": "It comes down to custom and tradition. For instance, with British royalty, they need to pick a British name. Custom dictates they can't go with something like Barbara or Fleur. Custom shows that typically they choose names to honor other family members or royalty. That's how they chose Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Diana as the three names for the Princess.
