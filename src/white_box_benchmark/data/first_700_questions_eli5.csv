Question,Answer
in football whats the point of wasting the first two plays with a rush - up the middle - not regular rush plays i get those,"Keep the defense honest, get a feel for the pass rush, open up the passing game. An offense that's too one dimensional will fail. And those rushes up the middle can be busted wide open sometimes for big yardage."
Why are different tiers (regular < mid < premium) of gas' prices almost always 10 cents different?,"As someone who uses quality Premium, I wish this was true."
Stars and Visibility,It's a quirk of the human eye. At the center of the eye (the fovea) we mostly have colour-sensitive cone cells to see detail and colour of what we're focusing on. Around the fovea we mostly have rod cells that can't see colour but are more sensitive to variations in light intensity and movement.  Looking slightly to the side of the thing you're examining sends more of the light to the rod cells and lets you see things more clearly in low-light conditions where cones don't work well.
How do we know all the money the government is getting from bank settlements is going back to the people?,I'm pretty confident most of it isn't going back to the people. That's how politics works.
What are good and bad sides of manual and automatic drive gear?,"Automatics weigh more, so that alone makes gas mileage worse. They are also more complicated, so that means reliability is going to be lower. It is easier to operate, which may free up your attention for focus on what is *outside* the car. Some people derive satisfaction from shifting, and flexibility in using the power curve."
How do muscles grow?,"I hope this answer qualifies as technical, yet simple enough (as I very rarely post here), but the basic idea that I understand is that your muscles rip and tear on a microscopic level when you are working out, and the harder you push those muscles, the more they rip. Hence where the idea comes from that more reps and less weight equal more tone, but more weight and less reps equal more muscle growth. What happens is that following those tiny rips and tears, your muscle heals over itself and essentially stacks on top of itself, healing bigger and stronger than before. The more those muscles are used, kept active and challenged, the more they will continue to build and grow over time. Other factors go into the growth of muscle as well, such as your nutrition. Protein, fats, etc. also play a factor, as they cause your body to ""feed"" your body and muscles in different ways of varying effectiveness - but I think that's an ELI5 for another day."
Why does the water from my kitchen faucet taste different than the water from my bathroom faucet? Doesn't it come from the same place?,"Yes, but the pipes going to one place could have a build up that's changing the taste or the composition of the pipes can be different, i.e. pvc pipes going to your kitchen, but copper pipes to your bathroom."
"If dark colours absorb more heat, why does light skin burn easier than dark skin?","Two things going on here. First, heat doesn't have anything to do with sunburn, it's all about UV rays. Encountering more UV rays = more sunburn. However, dark skin absorbs more UV rays than pale skin. And in fact that's exactly why it burns less. The pigmented layer absorbs more UV in the upper layers of the skin, shading the cells underneath from UV and preventing burns (because it's the lower, reproducing cells that matter, the upper ones are disposable protection). Just like sitting outside under an opaque black umbrella would shade you more than sitting outside under a translucent white one."
How the fuck does Facebook know about people I know?!,"Your email contacts, your academic/work institutions info you've put, and the friends of your friends."
Why is chickenpox worse as an adult?,"It's mostly due to the difference in immune system between a child and an adult. A primary varicella zoster infection (chickenpox) in adulthood is indeed associated with increased risk of complications. Most of these complications are due to the intense response by the adult immune system that comes into contact with the virus for the first time. Children have less active immune systems, but usually active enough to clear the virus - making them immune to it thereafter, and are therefore less likely to develop complications with this particular infection. The same goes to hepatitis A: adults develop jaundice, while children are asymptomatic.  Note: a secondary varicella zoster infection during adulthood is called ""shingles"" and is generally less dangerous than a primary varicella during adulthood, due to the immunity that is already present at the time of the second infection."
How do movies not get uploaded online in HD from movie theater employees before their DVD release?,"The theater will be fined a massive amount of money for allowing a leak, the person leaking it will be fined a massive amount of money for uploading it, and they automatically lose their job. This is a combination of copyright law violation and contracts that you sign when taking the job. So the risk are so extremely high that most will not risk it.  They also have security features such as login codes to open, proprietary file types that need special programs to play, and the rooms operating the projector system requiring special key access at times."
Can defense attorneys 'throw' a case if they know their clients are guilty?,"Yes, they could 'throw' a case. However, that's a serious ethics violation which would almost certainly cause disbarment if found out, and not only that, the conviction could then be appealed based on ineffective assistance of counsel (embodied in the 6th amendment). If it makes it easier to wrap your head around, think of defense lawyers defending the integrity of the judicial system, not just their client. The idea being, the system must obey all of its own rules in proving that someone is guilty, or else it's a dishonest system and could easily ""prove"" that an innocent person is guilty next time. Defense lawyers are there to help ensure the system stays honest."
"why, when intoxicated, does it feel like everything is spinning when you close your eyes but stops spinning when you open them?","the fluid in your inner ear keeps you orientated and standing upwards, although when your drunk certain functions in your brain don't work as well or as they are meant to. So if you've had a bit too much to drink, your brain might not be able to tell which way is up and which way is down if your inner ears are miscommunicating with your brain. So that's why when you close your eyes it feels like you're falling off the face of the world."
"Why are some fish bones edible, and others are not?","They are small and soft so it does not matter if you swallow them, bigger and harder bones might get stuck in your throat and couse pain"
"What's the meaning of the phrase ""I've got a bone to pick with you.""","If you have a bone to pick with someone, it means they've annoyed or insulted you and you need to talk to them about it. According to the Oxford English Dictionary (via a thread in /r/etymology) ""a bone to pick"" originally meant something that occupies or distracts you (as a dog is occupied by picking at a bone) and somehow morphed into its modern meaning."
Why can't we just taste candy or Sweets and then spit it out to avoid its unhealthy attributes? What makes us swallow it to get satisfaction?,"You absolutely could.  But the fact is that evolution shaped our tastes. That's why fatty foods and sweet foods are so appealing to out taste buds. It is our bodies way of saying ""That has lots of calories and will help us avoid starving."" The 'satisfaction' you feel on swallowing it is simply the body saying ""Good job. Remember that tastes good so we will eat it again if we find it again."" Rewarding you for fueling it.  You can see why this system that evolved when we were hunter gatherers to keep us from starving and helping us learn whats best to eat leads to obesity now that we have food options everywhere anytime we want.  Fun fact: Most people mistake the bodies thirst craving for being hungry. More often than not if you drink a glass of water when you feel the urge to snack it will go away. Thus helping you lose weight by reducing total calorie intake."
Why are the things that taste the best bad for us?,"Let's think about this from an evolutionary perspective. Way back in the day, (like way way way back) humans struggled for food just like every other animal. It was to our species evolutionary advantage to pursue food that would keep us full longer, or provide more energy than other food options. Fats, are 9 calories per gram compared to proteins and carbs that are 4 calories. Humans that preferred fats and craved them, had a higher chance of survival and passing on the fat craving trait. Fast forward to present day where food is plentiful. We are still programmed to eat high calorie foods just in case we won't find food for a week!"
Why do you see weird colors when you press your eyes?,"If I had to take a guess, no expert, just had anatomy and physiology through college, I'd imagine it'd have something to do with the rods and cones in your eyes and the optic nerve. When you push on your eyes, you probably disrupt the innervation action of the rods and cones and it's just trying to adjust back. Just my guess!"
"If a movie production has $5,000,000 (estimated) Budget, must some of that money go to the actors? or only movie's production quality?","It has to include equipment, pay for employees (all cast, crew, and extras), fees, *food* on larger productions, constryucting sets, making costume,s all of the makeup artists, set design, sound guy, camera guy, lighting guy, dozens of other specific jobs, and yes, the actors."
What classifies an island as an island? Aren't all continents etc essentially large islands?,"While not universally true (especially in the case of Europe who gets to be called its own continent for purely cultural/political reasons) A continent is considered to be the primary landmass on its tectonic plate. If you look at a map of tectonic plates: _URL_0_ You can clearly see that with a few notable exceptions such as Europe and India. In general continents occupy their own tectonic plate.  So then if you are a landmass that is part of a continent's tectonic plate but is not connected by land to that continent, than you would be an island. Although even this is a fairly tenuous definition."
why does wikipedia ask for donations almost every month? do they really need it to not disappear?,"Wikipedia's biggest issue is that their amazing service requires constant overhead. So donations keep it running. Have you ever been inside a server location. That shit is cold, and cold is expensive."
How does a water purifier jug work and could you put 3rd world ditch water through one and drink safely?,"The passive type of jug won't filter out bacteria and other things that can make you sick. There is a thing called [LifeStraw](_URL_0_) that can do this, but it forces water through a filter as you use it. Something like a reverse osmosis system can make water safe, but that also involves forcing water through a membrane. These things can't be done with just gravity."
Why people like getting drunk/sloshed/hammered/shit-faced ?,Because only when you're passed out in a puddle of your own vomit can you silence the ennui and existential hum.    Source: I'm Irish.
Why has the Mars Rover Opportunity's Lithium Ion Battery Lasted 11+ Years and the one in My Cell Phone/Laptop/Tablet Dies in Less Than 2?,"NASA requirements lean toward the 'overengineered' side (for good reason - if something goes wrong you can't replace it). The battery in your phone is more from the ""make it cheaper, they can always buy another battery"" school of engineering. (Just to clarify, I am not being cynical about phone/laptop batteries. Most people - me included - would rather not pay something like 100 times as much for a battery that is able to withstand operating on Mars and lasts several times longer.)"
Why is sales tax in the US excluded from the list price?,"Because every state has a different tax rate on goods, so that would make putting tax into the price a little difficult"
Why does a beer on tap almost always taste better than it does from a bottle?,"Probably because the keg has been better handled than the cases of beer have, and because bottles are not actually the best packages for beer. Light passes through the glass and can cause skunking, and oxygen can sneak in through the plastic seal in the crown, causing staling. Kegs are generally stored cold, and of course are completely opaque and are much more resistant to oxygen ingress."
What is the significance of Jamaican Bobsled team qualifies for the Olympics?,Let me tell you about a man...a great man...a man who helped the underdogs...a man who traveled by many forms...a man who loved his nieces and nephew. A man who left this world too early.  That mans name was John Candy.
Is it possible to build up an immunity to poisons both naturally occurring and man-made?,"Sort of. It's called [Mithridatism](_URL_0_), after a Roman-era king of Pontus (northern modern Turkey). But you can only do it with certain poisons; others just build up in your body until they kill you."
How do devices know the amount of charge left in a battery?,The Voltage of a battery depends on the charge. A five voltage battery may start with 5.1 Volt and slowly go down. When you're at 4.9 volt you'll know the battery is rather empty. I'm not sure if that is the case for all modern Rechargeable batteries. They might have special measuring and charging chips included.
Why are my muscles sore after jumping in cold water?,"From what I understand, our bodies defenses against hypothermia is to shiver. This involves involuntary muscle contractions to generate heat. These muscles contractions still can cause muscle soreness just like working out."
why do we like watching the same TV show or movie over and over again?,"Our brains like familiar things. Something we already have seen is easier to get into than something brand new because it requires less attention and effort from our brain. It's also sometimes good watching a TV show knowing the ending (eg Black Mirror, Lost) as we can pick up on foreshadowing or minor details."
why do the French have an abstain vote instead of people physically restraining from voting. [Other],"It's like a protest vote. I live in Nevada where we are allowed to vote ""none of the above."" If ""none of the above"" wins, the candidate with the most votes still wins. It doesn't affect anything here."
Why The Beatles broke up?,"They didn't so much as 'break up' as they just started doing different things by themselves, or with other people.  Eventually they just weren't doing things as 'The Beatles' anymore and decided to make it official. Paul said that they broke up because of: ""Personal differences, business differences, musical differences, but most of all because I have a better time with my family."""
- Why do phones not require cooling vents but other small appliances do?,"Phones lack a cooling system because there's no room for that. It takes up way too much space for a pocket-size device. If that wasn't an issue, phones would've had vents. Besides, phones don't work as hard as other computers do. They are weaker, so they produce less heat. Still, they can get hot sometimes, especially during charging, and there is nothing we can do about it. Phones cool by radiating heat away and through conduction - passing heat into the surrounding air/skin."
Why are oil prices so shockingly low?,"Someone feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is the Middle East put out so much supply to try and put US companies out of business which if successful they would then jack prices up and get money to themselves."
"If the inside of my microwave is made of metal, why is it bad to put metallic objects in it?","The metal interior of the oven is grounded. It does pick up a charge from the microwaves, but the charge is dissipated to ground, and so does not arc. Your fork, or the foil on your plate, are not grounded, and thus the charge can build up until it is strong enough to arc to a grounded panel."
"Why do we lack the instincts our ancestors had, e.g. telling you which foods are poisonous","We still have them. Ever gone ""EW"" from spoiled food and decided not to eat it? Ever smelled something horrible and realized that it wasn't edible?  The issue is that we've realized that there's a lot more items out there can that kill us, and notice it. Our ancestors would have just died from eating it, and then warned the surviving descendants to stay away from it."
Why do we wake up early when we don't have to but tend to wake up late when we need to be up?,The simple answer is stress causes this. By setting a schedule your body will fall into a rhythm. After a while you don't really need the alarm at all. However as we know our natural rythems get disturbed occasionally. When we must get up we are creating stress that is easiest to avoid by doing nothing and that is what we want to do (avoid stress). On the weekend you don't have stress to avoid and your body is doing its thing. A sign of depression (just one of the signs) is oversleeping. Your mind allowing your body to avoid the stress of life every chance you get. Feel good that you feel awake when you don't have to. Your life is manageable to you.
"Why do tech/software companies stay in the US when they are demanded to include backdoors by the US government? Can't tech companies just develop and release their products overseas, out of reach of the US government's influence?","The short answer is that it's not just the US government pushing to include ""backdoors."" Tech companies could move to a country without these laws, but places like the US could restrict or prohibit them from selling their products in the US. The better option is to follow Apple's example and refuse to build the backdoors."
"with such an important vote like appointing a supreme court nomine, why is the senate floor so empty?","Well, actually, that's not their one job. They also have to meet with people, work on legislation, and so on. Many of the Senators may be in their offices. When an important vote is called, they will come to the floor to vote. They can get from their offices to the floor in just a few minutes."
"If you put tires on your car that are larger than the ones from the factory, would you actually be going slower than the reading on your speedometer?","No, you'll actually be going faster. The speed is calculated based on the OEM tire size, whereas if you put a larger tire on, there is more circumference so the hub will spin slower, yet will be traveling the same speed. You can have it recalibrated fairly cheaply."
How does bugspray kills bugs?,"Bugspray is actually a chemical weapon. As in it shuts down biological functions bugs need to stay alive, like forgetting how to breathe for example. It can also cause military chemical weapons detection gear to register false positives."
"If a computer has a GPU, why would reducing GUI effects impact performance?","If you're talking about Windows Vista and beyond. **Disabling visual effects doesn't increase performance** More detailed explanation is here: _URL_0_ ELI5: This checkbox just switches off new system (GPU rendering) and brings back XP CPU rendering, because some software can't use new system. Starting from Windows Vista GUI is rendered on GPU(actually it's pretty complicated for compatibility reasons, old programs still use CPU rendering, and resulted bitmap is passed to GPU for composition and rendering)."
What happens if you don't pay your US Federal income tax?,"I'm no expert on Constitutional Law, but where did you hear that the US income tax has no basis in law and is unconstitutional? The entire purpose of the [16th amendment](_URL_0_) was to make the income tax permanent. It was ratified almost a century ago. People aren't tricked into paying it for no reason, you can go to jail for tax evasion. Your income tax is not necessarily deducted from your paycheck, it depends on your withholding allowance."
Why does my employer require a voided personal check in order to setup direct deposit?,Your banks routing number and your account number as well as your name exactly as it is written on your account are all printed on the check. That is the information they need to set up direct deposit. With the check they can be sure there are no mistakes.
Why are the insides of Ovens Dark and Not Metallic or Mirror Like?,How often do you polish the inside of your oven? I suspect a big reason would be just to keep the interior from quickly looking horrible.
Why does metal react so violently when microwaved?,"The way microwaves work is through jiggling charged/polar particles in your food (the water primarily). This jiggling increases their temperature and that heats up the rest of your food. That's why you can't heat oil as easily as you can water. However, metals like iron are *great* conductors of electrons. What makes them good conductors is a little complicated but basically, the reason is that they have a soup of electrons moving from atom to atom with almost 0 energy needed to move an electron from one atom to another.  Thus when the microwave jiggles these electrons, rather than giving energy to the atom, it gives it to the electron which zips around in the soup. The amount of energy given to the soup can get high enough to bypass the natural insulation of the air and cause electrons to jump from the metal and rip through the air. This is called a spark and is basically what happens during a lightning strike."
How did the American accent come about?,"It's not so much that Americans developed a distinct accent, but rather that speech on both sides of the Atlantic changed significantly, with both sides diverging quite a bit from what they had sounded like earlier on. This process is still happening, with accents on the Canadian and US sides of the great lakes undergoing vowel shifts at this very moment, and in opposite directions; Canadian and US accents are actually becoming less similar, even among people in the niagara region who live a few km apart. Why? We don't really understand this process at all well. The key thing relevant to your question though is that accents change a lot, that distance and separation make this process easier and more likely, and that neither English nor an American speakers sound much like their 16th century forebears."
"Why do The Miranda Rights state that anything you say can ""and will"" be used against you. If something's not incriminating why would it be used against you? Why would cops be forced to admit this up front?","Its just to put emphasis on the fact that *they will* use any and all evidence against you that they can, including anything you say or do."
Why is it when you rewind VHS tapes they lose their quality over time?,"Since rewinding needs to be done for each playback, what makes you think it is the rewinding which causes quality loss? Tapes lose quality over time whether you play them or not due to breakdown of the binder and dry lubricant. Rewinding is no more damaging than playback if the VCR is functioning correctly.  There is a phenomenon called [print-through](_URL_0_) which transfers signal from one layer to the next. Professional audio engineers often store reel to reel tapes ""tails out"". That means without rewinding. It doesn't stop print-through, but it does make it happen later rather than earlier, so on playback it will be heard after a track rather than before. Source: 40 years experience in broadcast VTR/VCR maintenance."
"When a new library is built, where do they get their books? I understand many can be bought brand new from publishers. But, what about the old books, or the vast volumes of dated encyclopedias, dated periodicals, etc...","Librarian here. A lot of that stuff comes from stores and reserves from other libraries in the system. My library authority has been around since 1890 and has accumulated decades of stuff that due to archiving policies /librarian OCD hoarding we never throw out, For example we have 23 libraries in our group with over 750,000 items. Around a 1/6 of that stock is reserves and then rotated to other libraries so it appears new to the customers of that branch. Encyclopaedias are really common actually, especially older ones we have around 10 full sets of the most common things like Britannica and Oxford. Any book dealer will most likely have a few sets kicking around if you are short. In the UK the British Library has virtually every book and periodical ever published, I assume the Library of Congress is the same in US and we can get copies of stuff from them.  TL:DR a combination of stuff hidden in basements and storage supplemented by specialist periodical providers"
"If the ozone layer is made up of O3, why are we not producing some of it ourselves and pumping more of them into the atmosphere to fix the problem faster?","> Ozone is a powerful oxidizing agent, far stronger than O2. It is also **unstable at high concentrations**, decaying to ordinary diatomic oxygen. [...] In a sealed chamber, with fan moving the gas, ozone has a **half-life of approximately a day at room temperature**. _URL_0_ TL;DR: It is very unstable. It will decay fairly quickly; half of the ozone you make today will be gone tomorrow, turned into regular oxygen gas."
Is it possible to be a 'man without a country'?,"It is entirely possible to be such a person, it's called statelessness. At one point, Einstein was stateless. However, renouncing your citizenship means you have no protection by any state. This is very bad, as we are as a species very largely reliant on our respective corporate states of the world. I personally identify as a citizen of no country, if you wish to go stateless, I suggest you study the subject further and figure out how to survive without a state."
"In the English language, how are contractions prioritized when a word can belong to two different contractions?","It's a matter of emphasis. ""We aren't going"" could be simply spoken, or the ""we"" could be emphasized (an emphasis that is lost in simple text). Similarly ""We're not going"" could be used to emphasize the ""not"" part. Beyond that it's preference. The stylistic choices of language are everywhere, and it's one of the main reasons that most sentences of reasonable length have never been written before."
"The Cuban Missle Crisis and Americas enormous beef with Cuba, what happened there?","The beef wasn't with Cuba, the beef was with the USSR. The Soviets were trying to use their communist ally in The West as a beachhead for terror. (Not the modern definition of terror, the old-fashioned one). By placing ICBMs in Cuba (aimed at the United States) they wanted to cast a cloak of fear over the U.S. Cold War tactics at its finest."
Why doesn't it rain salt water?,"When water evaporates, it gets heated to an extent that the water particles move faster and spread apart, which causes them to become ""lighter"" than the air around them, turning into water vapor, a gas. Due to this, they rise up into the atmosphere. Then, they start to cool down, and become liquid again. When they become cool enough that they're heavier than the air, it rains back down. This is the basic water cycle. The salt which makes it salt water requires a much higher temperature to turn into gas, one which doesn't normally happen during this cycle. Because of this, it does not follow the water, and thus, it doesn't rain salt water."
Why can't we use a centrifuge to de-salinate ocean water?,"A centrifuge is typically used to separate a heterogeneous mixture of solid and liquid by spinning it. Salt water is a solution, so if it is even possible, I am sure the energy, time and expense are enormous."
What is a MAC Address?,"It's a unique device address given to each piece of network connected hardware. It's different from an IP address because it's permanent: every device has one and only one MAC address, but it is given a new IP address every time it connects.  Edit: You can think of the MAC address as a device's permanent name, and the IP address as an instruction for other devices to find it. Your device *is* MAC number X, and it *can be found at* IP address Y."
How are adept music players able to just start playing along to anything that someone else plays and have it sound good?,"Experience, mostly. If you know the key something is played in and it's rythem, you can throw just about anything in and sound good."
Why drill instructor in the army never stop screaming at recruit in the army?,"Armies thrive on the discipline of individual soldiers. One soldier not doing his/her job can be responsible for getting the entire unit killed in battle. Having a drill sargeant yell at you to run faster or do more pushups is a lot less frightening than being shot at, but if you can't handle being yelled at then how can anybody trust you to have their back when you're in real danger?"
"if i ground up a piece of pure iron and ate it, would my body abosorb it the same way as iron from food? if not, how do they make iron supplements absorb-able?","You eat shaved iron every time you have breakfast cereal. If you take total cereal, crush it up, add a little milk to make a broth consistancy, and stir it with a strong magnet, you will see actual iron shavings sticking to your magnet. _URL_0_"
Whats is the actual cause of the common itch. and why is scratching it the cure?,1: dead skin 2: your body's reaction to get rid of it. Bonus: a lot of dust in your house is said dead skin.
"When popcorn is popping, what is actually happening to the kernel inside?","As the kernel is heated, the moisture and oils are being heated inside. Since the outer shell of popping corn is strong and mostly impenetrable, there is no place for the heat and pressure to go and the insides are superheated. The starches inside, which are normally hard, begin to soften in a process called gelatinization. Interior pressure continues to rise until the kernel's shell ruptures. Steam rapidly expands causing the innards to expand in a foamy substance, which afterwards quickly cools into a crispy puff."
What happens to your brain when you space out?,"There are two kinds of spacing out. There is background processing - thinking about stuff that isn't apparent to you consciously, and basically resting your mind.  For most of evolutionary history, energy was the limiting factor for most species. Sleeping is not only helpful for repairing your body, but also for reducing your calorie burden. Spacing out is a kind of low energy state that is more alert than sleeping but less energy consuming than active thinking."
What is the point of a Kroger's Shopper card?,"The general idea is that by offering a discount card, you will shop more frequently at that specific chain than others (although in reality, this isn't often the case). They may also collect your email to send you regular marketing ads, in hopes of bringing you in. If the extra profit generated from you buying items at that store vs another store exceeds the discounts given on that trip, then the store benefits."
Why haven't our bodies changed to make childbirth less painful?,"So the only way that the process of childbirth would change is through evolution of some kind. The only way evolution happens is if the genetically superior reproduce and those who aren’t die. Theoretically if there was a woman who could go through childbirth totally painlessly and she passed that trait on to her child, the child could pass the trait on and on until it made up the mass populous. This would take millions of years and to guarantee that all women experienced it, all who felt pain during childbirth would have to not reproduce.  Think about it like this. Apples were high on the tree. All the long necked giraffes reached the apples, lived and eventually reproduced. All the shortnecked giraffes died and that’s why we only today see long necked giraffes."
American TV shows compared to The rest of the world.,The amount of American hate / bashing on Reddit is amazing.
How do people add colour so accurately to black and white photos?,"It's basically painting a transparent picture on top of the black-and-white, and the B/W image provides much of the shading.  In the days before photoshop, you had actual transparent inks with limited tints to choose from, and that's why old hand-colorized photos often look more cartoony. Now, you can pick from a vast range of colors until it more or less matches what you would expect: a white person with fair hair will probably have skin in X color range, unpainted wood furniture is going to be a shade of brown, jeans are almost certainly blue, a military uniform from that era is going to be this particular color, etc.  Plus if you have experience with B/W photography you might have a sense for how some colors will translate to film; they often have a particular range of grey due to the characteristics of a given film. So accurate colorizing mostly comes down to digital painting skill and having a sense for how things would look."
How do service animals help autistic children?,"Multiple ways, and by the way it's not just autistic *children* who can benefit from service animals. Among other things: * service animals can detect the early signs of a meltdown or shutdown, which are things often (but not exclusively) triggered by sensory overstimulation, and can provide a prompt to leave the situation causing that overstim * they can provide active stimulation to aid with grounding * they can help reinforce ritual, which is frequently important for autistic people"
"Why do books downloaded from the library need to be ""returned"" after a given amount of time?","> This makes no sense because downloads are not limited like physical copies of books are. Downloads are limited in the sense that the library has to pay for every copy of a book that they own, including digital copies. So they pay the publisher $X for permission to lend some fixed number of digital copies. And the reader software is set up to that the borrower isn't able to retain possess of that copy forever. If that weren't the case, then book sales would drop essentially to nothing, since everyone could just get a free copy of any book whenever they wanted for as long as they wanted."
How does Stephen Hawking's speech computer work?,He has a small sensor in his mouth and uses his cheek muscle to type with it. His computer also has the ability to predict and correct words for him.
If a self-driving car detects multiple courses of action (all of which will likely result in human injury) how will it determine which course to take?,"It will do whatever it is programed to do in that situation. Self driving cars are not true conscious A.I - they are just really, really complex ""if...then"" programs. If it gets into a situation where an accident is unavoidable, it will do what its programing tells it to do in that situation. As far as liability, we don't know yet. It's possible that the programer would be liable for the accident but we'll need a court case to set precedent before we really know."
why does spicy food make me sweat?,"""The answer hinges on the fact that spicy foods excite the receptors in the skin that normally respond to heat. Those receptors are pain fibers, technically known as polymodal nociceptors. They respond to temperature extremes and to intense mechanical stimulation, such as pinching and cutting; they also respond to certain chemical influences. The central nervous system can be confused or fooled when these pain fibers are stimulated by a chemical, like that in chile peppers, which triggers an ambiguous neural response."" Source: _URL_0_"
"If there are no size regulations regarding goalies in the NHL, why doesn't a team just throw some really obese person out there to block the whole net?","An NHL goal is 6 feet wide by 4 feet wide. I doubt there's many people actually large enough to block that entire area. And if there is someone that big, I doubt they'd be able to stand up and skate their way out to the net."
"If animals aren't aware that they are going to die, why would they try so hard to survive?","Does a falling ball ""know"" it's trying to return to Earth? Or does it just do what it must? Animals behave out of instinct. When hungry, they are driven to eat. At a certain time of year, they are driven to mate. When startled, they automatically flee. They don't know the effects of these actions, but that isn't necessary."
"How can a computer come up with a ""random"" number?","Generally yes, anything generated by an algorithm can be reproduced if you know the ""initial"" settings. Numbers generated this way are referred to as ""psuedorandom"".  There do, however, exist various dedicated hardware solutions that allow computers to pick truly random numbers. They work by basically installing in the computer some sort of sensor that can detect random properties of nature.  An example might be some sort of detector that picks up low levels of radiation. While we can make statistical predictions of radioactive decay over time, the actual decay of individual particles is truly random, and cannot be predicted with perfect accuracy. A sensor designed to measure those tiny random variations and feed them to a computer could generate truly random numbers."
Why are scars near impossible to get rid of?,"Scar tissue is different to normal skin. It contains more collagen than regular tissue, and doesn't structure the same as regular skin, which is why it looks so different. It's also less flexible. The benefits to having scar tissue is the body can recover from wounds exceptionally quickly - many animals can't create scar tissue, and so wounds can remain open longer and are more susceptible to infection and other problems. Conversely, other animals can regenerate entire limbs whereas we can't. Interestingly, the collagen in your scar tissue is constantly replaced. If your body stops producing collagen (due to certain illnesses), your scars' wounds can actually reopen. The scar is difficult to get rid of because the tissue has been created in a less structured/ordered form than your regular skin (because it was deployed quickly to help heal the wound), but some medical procedures exist to reduce that effect."

Why is it when oil prices go up gas prices immediately go up but when oil prices come down the price of gas never comes down as fast as when the price of oil increases?,"On TV, when the price of gas goes up, they say they have no choice but to sell it higher in gas stations too. But when the price goes down, they say that they had already bought a lot of gas when it was higher so they cannot lower the prices immediately or they'd lose money on it. There is probably a good explanation for it but my guess is that it's another of these ""Heads I win, Tails, you lose"" situation ;)"
"Does time ever end, or is the future infinite?","That's a really good question, as if deals with the metaphysical in a physical context; basically, the universe will end before time ends, so we have no real way of knowing. However, one could argue that time will end when physical existence ends; in that case, the end of time will come with the end of the Universe."
"Why ""crazy people"" have that distinctive look to their eyes","In many psychotic individuals, the wide eyed look is because of their intense anxiety levels. It's more than just the eyes though. In someone psychotically agitated, you'll see facial grimacing and body postures indicating stress or aggression as well. The scariest patients are the ones that have a flat affect, meaning they just have a blank stare all the time. Though many of them are lost in their own world and harmless, some are not. They are concerning because i can't judge their propensity towards violence at any given time. Source: IAMA Psychiatric RN"
What is the point of money?,"It facilitates trade. I want apples, but have oranges. You want oranges, but want bananas. Jim wants bananas and has apples. None of us can make a deal we want by dealing one-to-one, we'd all have to be together at the same time and value the fruit identically. Money let's us do one-to-one deals and sequentially get the stuff we want."

how does a home equity loan work?,"A home equity loan is a loan that is based off the difference between the value of the house and the current balance of the primary mortage. If you paid $50,000 for a house that's worth $75,000, you can get $25,000 in equity loans.  Subsequently, if your house was worth $75K when you bought it and it's now worth $135K because reasons, you can now get that much more in your equity loan. In theory, you don't have to wait at all to get a loan. If you sign on the dotted line for the $75K house for a $50K mortgage, you could turn right around that day and get a $25K equity loan. you just have to have the equity in the house to get the loan."
"In English, what is the rule for the use of “An” or “A”","An is used for words that start with a vowel sound. Examples, An owl, an hour, an eight, an apple, an onion. A is used for all others."
Why do we have two small nostrils and not one larger nostril?,"It's usually not noticeable unless you sniff harshly, but one nostril is usually more open and free-flowing than the other.  The nostril that's closed usually swaps back and forth after several hours throughout the day. When a nostril is more closed, it's swollen, because the blood vessels inside the nose are swollen.  During that time, your immune system attacks all the nasty stuff that came into your nose. It's harder to breathe when that happens. But your other nostril is wide open and maximum air comes in.  This combination of having one closed nostril and one open nostril is a super efficient way for your body to both clean the nasties and breathe full air at the same time. If it was all just 1 nostril, then every few hours you would have difficulty breathing.  Air breathed through the nostrils are combined in the back and flow into both longs. One nostril does not lead into one lung."
How the heck do authorities determine who started a massive fire in the middle of the woods somewhere?,"As a random side point I lit fire to my bathroom on accident with a candle. The glass holder got hot and broke, the countertop started burning, and a towel had gotten caught before I realized it. It happened super fast and I panicked while throwing water and wet towels on things. My dad, who is a fire investigator, came home the next morning and 5 seconds in the door asked me what burned (he hadn't seen it just smelled). I tried to tell him but obviously my story didn't match up to the burnt remains. I wasn't lying, I just genuinely couldn't remember cause I was so panicked. Anyway, he was able to give an exact play by play of how it started, what it caught next, etc. Tl:dr; fire investigators know their crap. Edit:typo"
How do film/tv productions handle deaths of actors? Examples?,"Usually it leaves them scrambling. I know when John Ritter died they actually had to write that death into ""8 Simple Rules""."
What would happen if all the countries wiped all the debt incurred by and owed to each other?,Not an expert in the topic but I have some knowledge Debt isn't necessarily a bad thing as it represents a flow of money. This is why the average lifestyle in America is comfortably more lavish than those of in China. This is made possible because Americans are in better position to take out large loans and pay them back in the future. If all the debt were to be wiped out then that would mean banks would lose a very high percentage of income. Heres where my knowledge stops as my train of thought has been limited to what I know.

How does the _URL_0_ door knocking audio clip do such a good job of making it sound like the audio doesn't come from your headphones?,"Ha, had the speakers on when I played that audio clip and the cat **freaked** out. Apparently that knock knock fools animals into thinking someone's at the front door too. Your brain determines the location of a sound's source by a few different factors. Namely, distortion differences between each ear, and delay in which ear hears the sound first. Technology has gotten good enough that with proper equipment it can re-create those effects and trick your brain. We usually use the term ""binaural"" as in ""Two ear"" to describe the effect. One of the most famous examples of binaurual audio is the ""Virtual haircut"" clip _URL_1_ where they demo a technology designed to create the effect. Lots of ASMR artists and other people do it too, one popular device these days is [a 3Dio twin mic setup such as this](_URL_0_). With two microphones and extremely accurate recreation of the human ear shape (it affects how sound bounces about), you can recreate a whole room's soundscape effectively."
Computer/TV Screen Size Pricing,"Easier, yes, in the sense that the assembly requires less pricise equipment. Not necessarily cheaper, though, because of the material costs."
"Why do people think Yellowstone will explode and destroy the earth, but not worry about Hawaii's volcano eruption?","Imagine you're filling water balloons. One of them has a hole that lets out the water about as fast as you are filling it. You could stand there all day and be fine. That's how Kilauea erupts. The other one is huge. It is also intact. Eventually, it will burst and soak you. That would be a Yellowstone eruption.  Obligatory edit: Thanks /u/arcmokuro for my first gilding. I didn't expect the classic water balloon analogy to blow up like this."
How does cutting down trees to plant other vegetation for the purpose of cultivation (such as avocado farming) contribute to global warming?,"When you cut down highly developed forests to replace them with cultivated land you're seriously lowering the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed. A big tree that is several decades old will take in WAY more CO2 than several seedlings that are planted to replace it. Additionally, all of the undergrowth that is in forests absorbs CO2 but that is all removed for farming. Further, a lot of the time what's done is called ""slash and burn"" which means that the forests are chopped down and the debris is cleared away via a controlled fire, once again adding CO2 (and other harmful chemicals) to the atmosphere. Also, removing well established plants will significantly increase soil erosion and while that may not directly contribute to global warming, it certainly is detrimental to the environment."
What happens to Lactose when ingested by Lactose-Intolerants?,"So, from what I've understood in the past, people who are lactose-intolerant aren't able to break down lactose. Their body doesn't produce enough lactase, which is an enzyme that breaks down lactose. So, depending on how much lactose is taken in, it usually is broken down by bacteria instead in the gut. This causes a bunch of side effects like, nausea, bloating, gas, and stomach cramps."
"If Helicopters need tail rotors to stabilize themselves from spinning, how can turboprop airplanes have only one rotor and not spin in circles?","On a helicopter the main rotor blades are the wings, a plane has fixed wings that use the air to resist the torque of the prop that's trying to make the plane roll (this is also why single prop driven planes roll to one side faster than they can to the other)"
"What is the difference between an air-conditioner and a ""marine"" air conditioner (commonly used on boats)?","Caveat - I mess with boats but I'm not expert or pro. In general marine equipment is made with more corrosion resistant materials,such as stainless steel. The A/C on my boat exchanges the heat in the cabin air into water that flows through the other side of the heat pump, so this is an air/water heat pump where most home units are air/air heat pumps. Also some or most marine units are 12 Volt DC power, possibly also 24 volt. I think some few are powered directly off the engine via a 'fan belt'. The reefer on my boat is three way power - 120 VAC, 12 VDC, and propane. I suppose this would be possible in A/C but I've ever heard of this."
Why do people bother keeping savings in banks/currencies which are potentially unstable?,"I see two reasons: 1. In most European countries you need a residence permit to open a bank account. In other words, you must live in the country where you want the bank account. Some countries, like Switzerland, allow foreigners to open bank accounts without a permit. However, the banking fees are high for such customers ( > 800$ per year). Unless people have substantial amounts of money ( > 100,000$) the fees will erase their savings. As it happens, many people in Ukraine are not very wealthy. 2. It is difficult. You need to go abroad, speak a foreign language, spend significant amount of time and money. Most don't bother."
"Why does water freeze from top to bottom? Deep in the ocean it’s below freezing, why doesn’t it freeze?","There are several reasons. The salt in the ocean lowers the temperature needed to make it freeze. Currents stop the ice from bonding, and if Ice did freeze, it is less dense and floats. But the main reason is the pressure, especially in deep water. To freeze, water needs to expand. Deep in the ocean, the pressure from the water stops it from being able to expand."

The voting rights of citizens in the District of Columbia historically differ from the rights of citizens in each of the 50 U.S. states. Why can't the U.S. just add an amendment to fix that right now?,"Because politics quickly becomes political. Currently D.C. is extremely Democratic, so Republicans don't want 2 new Democratic Senators. If the situation was reversed it's likely that the sides would quickly flip and Democrats would be blocking the amendment."
I've been reading up on nukes. Did the Nevada nuclear tests have nuclear winter? Why or why not?,"Nuclear Winter is not a local effect resulting from an atomic blast, but rather a hypothetical effect from lots of nukes going off. The theory is that the nukes would kick a lot of soot and dust up in to the air, blocking out the sun. The blocking out of the sun would result in lower temperatures since the sun can't heat up as much of the Earth anymore. Some of the effects are based on similar effects felt when a large volcano goes off. Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines went off in the early 90's and we only saw a slight drop in temperature (1 degree F)."
How come cars are able to go up to 220 km/h but highways only allow speeds of up to 110 km/h. Wouldn't it be wiser to have cars max out at 110 km/h-ish and reduce the engine capabilities?,"How long do you want to take to accelerate? Merging onto the highway in a reasonable time takes far more power than maintaining a constant speed. There are plenty of 1.0 l cars for sale in Europe. They take about 17 +/- seconds to reach 100 kph, but they are very fuel efficient. No one would buy them here in the US because it would be frankly frightening to try to merge onto our freeways in a car that slow."

Why is the word 'cunt' such a taboo word in the U.S.?,"People have made it so. Words can be given such power based on how they're used in the culture. I remember when Austin Powers 2 came out (it was called Austin Powers 2: The Spy Who Shagged Me), and that was seen as quite vulgar for British people.  In the US, Shagged is a cute word (like using Poop in place of the word Shit). Just remember that it is how it is taken, not how it is intended. You could be using cunt like the Aussies do in friendly conversation (referring to their friends), but someone who isn't used to hearing that can still take offense to it."
Why is the USA drinking age set at 21 when in most other respects you're an adult at 18.,"In the 60s and 70s, the US had a **lot** of fatalities as a result of teenage drunk driving. Waaay more than any other country did. Really, there were two options available to them: raise the drinking age, or raise the driving age. I think they made the right choice."
Why do I not smell perfume I've sprayed on me but other people do?,"Why don't you see your nose? It's within your vision. Your brain filters out your nose, because it's always there, and likewise, it filters out smells that are ""always there"".  The phenomenon is called [sensory adaptation](_URL_0_), this is the brain caring less about constant stimuli. Olfactory neurons also fire less frequently."
How does a two headed reptile/siamese twins work? How do they move their bodies assuming there are two brains?,"Typically each twin controls a different part of the body. Like the twin girls Brittany and Abigail Hensel. They give the appearance of being one body with two heads, though they have two of each organ above the waist. They have two arms, each controlling one. And from the waist down, they have one body, with each controlling one half. So each controls a leg, for example. There doesn't appear to be any part that both of their brains controls. So they coordinate with each other so that they can walk, but they each have their own body parts they use. In some cases of animals with two heads, only one head ""works"". The other head doesn't seem to have any reactions to stimuli so it's vestigial."
"why aren't AK47's an ""accurate"" rifle","1. AK-47's distance between the sight and post is very short which makes it so that for longer ranges, it is extremely difficult to line up an accurate shot as you are more likely to be misaligned with your eye to the sights. 2. It uses a relatively low velocity round, meaning it arcs more and spends more time to get to the target, making it deviate more from environmental conditions 3. Its feeding mechanism uses very large and heavy moving parts which reduces accuracy dramatically from recoil. 4. It has a more significant recoil upon firing due to its type of ammunition, making subsequent rounds less accurate. 5. It operates on a lot looser tolerances, while making it more reliable, also reduces its overall accuracy. 6. [Its gun barrel flexes more than other guns during recoil.](_URL_1_) Compare that with [this](_URL_2_), Or [this](_URL_0_) 7. The barrel isn't inline with the stock, making recoils want to push the gun upwards."
Why can I not remember what happens when I'm drunk?,"Memories enter the brain first as short term memory, that is then transformed into a long-term memory.  This is evident because the majority of short-term memories that we experience are lost before they ever make it into what we will call ""long-term"" storage.  When alcohol is consumed it affects your ability to take short-term memories and transform them into long-term memories.  This is why you only may remember small bits and pieces of the night, these are the select short-term memories that were allowed to settle into long-term ones without the interruption of alcohol. As the level of alcohol drops, the number of memories that make it into ""long-term' storage increases."
"Why does having noise in the background (TV, music, etc.) make me feel safer when I'm home alone?","Your ears are sensitive through a wide ride of volumes. When it is very quiet, you hear faint noises you are unaccustomed to, which can be disconcerting. Background noise hides those sounds with ones more familiar to you, restoring your comfort level."
Isn't the freshwater we have to work with just going in a cycle? How are we losing fresh water?,"When the water ends up in the oceans, it slows down the cycling a lot. Water in aquifers (the stores under the ground that we access when we use wells) and water on Earth's surface are the cheapest to use. We have been either polluting these (surface) or using them too fast for new water to filter in. We have also allowed a lot of water to go to the ocean(storm water runoff from developed areas) , rather than slowly go into the aquifers through the ground. So the result is we are using aquifer water faster than they are getting refilled. When that water is depleted, all water will become more expensive. We will still have it, but it will either be salty, polluted, or far from where it needs to be, and all of the fixes for this cost money. Sorry if this isn't too coherent, I haven't finished my first cup of coffee for the day."
Why is there such a large Insane Clown Posse (Juggalo) following?,"A lot of it is because the group tries to make its fans into a ""community"" (Juggalos). Like, fans of a band like, say, the Black Keys, are just people who happen to like the Black Keys. But ICP specifically encourages fans, ""Hey, dress up like us, be like us, be part of something,"" and then the fans encourage each other to do it too. People like that. They like feeling like they're part of a group. It's the same kind of thing with Lady Gaga and her ""Little Monsters,"" just a different type of music."
"Why metal at room temperature feels cold while, say, fabric at room temperature doesn't","I believe it has something to do with the rate at which heat from your body is transferred to the material. Your body is hotter than both the fabric and the spoon, which are at the same temperature, but the spoon conducts the heat at a faster rate and so you feel it as being colder. Please correct me if I am wrong or missing some details."

Why do southern states freak out over a little snow?,"There is essentially no infrastructure to deal with snowfall in southern states because it happens so rarely. Roads are not salted or plowed so they are covered in ice, and nobody has snow tires or much experience driving in snow. It is sort of like how everyone up north has trouble with a little heat wave where it gets over 100 F; nobody has A/C and are not acclimated to heat so it is a problem."

"What are those bastardly little tongue sores you get from eating too much salt or sugar, and how do you get rid of them?","The condition is called aphthous stomatitis, or commonly, canker sores. They are NOT inflamed tastebuds. Rather, they are small ulcers (areas of inflamed, healing tissue) that are characteristically painful and confined to the mucosa (soft tissue) of the mouth (including surface of the tongue) by definition. There is no cure, but many over-the-counter drugs are sold that can mitigate the pain caused by them. This question is by no means explained (moderators, hello?). Rather, the pathogenesis (how it develops) of an aphthous sore is still unknown. I couldn't believe it, but apparently this is an area of relatively active research. [This](_URL_1_) recent review article provides some nice context. [This question](_URL_0_) has been asked many times before. Doing a quick look-over, answers have been repeatedly unscientific and certainly not in any real laymen-speak."
Why are swearing words related to genitals and/or sexuality?,"Swear words come from things we consider taboo or distasteful. In English-speaking society, we have a lot of taboos surrounding sex, even in this day and age. We also put a very high level of importance on hygiene, so words relating to waste and where they come from are also taboo.  Certain words automatically make your brain think of a subject in a more intense way than others. A colloquial term vs a scientific one. This is true for pretty much anything, even if it isn't a swearword -- sweat vs perspiration, for example. When it's a topic that's taboo, that word becomes a swear. When it isn't, it moves back into innocuous territory."

So I know perhaps you've always been told to do the ""Come here"" motion but it's actually okay to be a little bit rougher than that, nearly all the nerves are located outside and in the clitoris. So use your dominant hand for entry and place the other hand palm down thumb towards you, gently but firmly across the lower pelvis. Use your two fingers with dominant hand to move entire fore arm in a controlled vibration sort of motion. Check with female on pressure and intensity. Use clitoral stimulation at your discretion. Hope that makes sense!"
Why do we hear static from radios and TV's when there's nothing being broadcast? Shouldn't we just hear silence?,"Because there isn't nothing there. Every spectrum is full of random noise from stars, radioactive decay, all sorts of things like that. It's just terrestrial broadcasts are so much stronger that it overwhelms the random noise. This is why when you start reaching the edge of the coverage area for the station you're listening to, it starts getting more and more static-ey and doesn't just go from ""fine"" to ""nothing."""

Why do dogs go absolutely crazy after getting a bath?,"A bath is a time when dogs get much attention and get touched and scrubbed all over. A dog can become emotionally overwhelmed from this extreme attention.  Also, the situation of getting soaked to the skin is unusual for the dog, perhaps stressful, because their undercoat is an important protection to them. To get this undercoat wet ""against their will"" so to speak, while being restrained, can make them stress. These things can combine to overexcite the dog. To discharge this overexcitement, the dog may go apeshit - running, shaking water off, frenzied actions. In short, blowing off steam."
What was the warsaw uprising,"Warsaw was under Nazi rule. People didn't like that, especially the Jews living in the ghetto. People were purposely starved, killed in the streets. The Polish Underground State was formed - a resistance paramilitary which was made of several groups that wanted to liberate Poland (and save Jews).  Some folks with radios learned that the Red Army was coming. And the Reds hate the Nazis. And the Polish Resistance thought ""Hey! If we fight the Nazis from within - and the Reds help out - we'll totally fuck the Nazi shit up!""  The Resistance started fighting - but the Red Army never came to help them. Those dudes camped outside the city. The Poles fought the Nazis for two months, much of the city was in ashes, and Churchill was all like ""HEY STALIN, COME HELP OUR POLISH ALLIES!"" and Stalin was kinda like, ""I don't want to risk my dudes quite yet.."" That's the Warsaw Uprising."

Why do DVDs in widescreen format play with black bars on top and bottom on my widescreen TV,"Just because it's ""widescreen"" doesn't mean that it's the same exact aspect ratio as your TV. A movie with black bars on the top and bottom was filmed in an aspect ration that's even wider than your widescreen TV.  Look [here](_URL_1_). Most widescreen TV's are 16:9 (the third from the bottom on that page), and many movies are filmed in 2.39:1 (the one on the very bottom). Clearly, you cannot shrink the bottom one to fit on a 16:9 screen without having bars at the top and bottom with no picture. Well, you can if you can tolerate a distorted, squished picture.

How do spammers spoof a cell phone number to make scam calls?,"When you make an outbound call, the calling system gives the phone system the caller ID information. The reason this can be (legitimately) different from the actual call is for example a business that has both direct lines to each extension and a main line. An employee calling out would show up with the main line as their caller ID so that if the person calls back they get the main number (this way you’re not giving out the direct number unless you needed to).  The spammers take advantage of this system to spoof a number in the caller ID.  The phone company could counter this by comparing the caller ID info with a number you legitimately own, but they get a lot of money for all these spam calls and they’re not incentivized enough to change how they do things."
How have wolves impacted Yellowstone?,"This is just one example.  More grazing animals means less vegetation for other animals to use as a home or shelter from prey. They also took vegetation away from the river banks causing more erosion. (The roots held the soil in place) The reintroduction of wolves stopped that and kept the grazing animal population in check, allowing the vegetation to grow back."
What is the difference between a CEO and the President of a company?,"""President"" is a term that is often based on the law of the place where the company is created. For example in the United States, most states require that a corporation have a person with the title President. That title carries with it some legal obligations that tie the individual to the actions of the company. Most jurisdictions don't define or require anyone to hold the title ""Chief Executive Officer"".  Depending on the size of the entity, the President and the CEO may be the same person. Large entities may be comprised of several smaller companies, each with a legally required ""President"", who may report to the CEO at the top of the organizational structure. Some companies may separate the two titles for internal organizational reasons, for historical reasons, or because someone thinks it's clever. It is rare for a company to have a CEO who reports to a President. CEO has become the de facto title for ""the highest level of the executive ladder"", but that's arbitrary and fashion could change."
"Why is it, that when I get really tired, everything is so much funnier?","The phenomenon of being more easily amused falls under Emotional Lability which means emotional changeability or instability. You're probably more likely to cry too. In extreme cases, this is a medical condition, see _URL_0_ but in regular life, it's just that the parts of your brain which keep you on an even keel aren't working quite so well."
How do people get infected with plaque?,Plaque isn't just one bactera it is what is known as a biofilm. Layers and layers of diferent bactera and their extracellular matrixs. Pretty much any bactera can eventually form biofilms. Everyone has bactera on and in their bodies called their natural flora. Your natural flora bactera grow into the plaque on your teeth.
Why does a company like Boeing need to make a commercial? It's not like anyone watching is going to buy one.,"Companies that have to choose between Airbus or Boeing still consist of people (who can be manipulated through commercials), and they can sadly often do so with bias even though they're supposed to run the numbers and make an informed decision."
How do American football have bruised lungs without also having broken ribs? Isn't that the point of ribs?,"This is actually one of the major issues with American football. The padding protects from the blunt hit and spreads out the impact so you aren't taking a lot of force to a particular place on your body, but your body is still being shoved really hard as a whole. This means the force is spread out and absorbed a bit so your skeleton isn't taking such a direct impact, but since a body at rest tends to stay at rest, when you get hit, your organs like to stay where they are as your skeleton is forced to move and they bang around inside their cage."
What are dentists actually doing when they scrape at your teeth with those metal picks?,I think my dentist was counting money while my hygienist was scraping my teeth.
When did we stop having to type in 'www.'? Why did we have to to begin with?,"It's because servers where traditionally named according to the services they provide. So a world wide web server had www., a file transfer protocol server had ftp., et caetera. We stopped having to type it because nowadays, the www._URL_0_ and _URL_0_ URLs both refer to the same server (URL is like a set of coordinates on a map that is given to your web browser to go and find the web site). Some sites don't, and so typing either form might yield different results. Most browsers also add the www. in automatically, to stop any problems that might occur."
What is the difference between real and imaginary numbers?,"The real numbers are all the numbers you grew up working with - 1,2,3,4, 4.5, 1/3, 1.2345, -27, 3.1415... and so on. When you limit yourself to the real numbers, the square root of -1 is undefined - there's just no possible number it can be. To get around this, mathematicians defined **i** as the square root of -1. Giving you `i * i = -1`. Imaginary numbers are any real number multiplied by **i** : i, 2i, 3i, 4i, 4.5i, i/3, 1.2345\*i, -27i, 3.1415...\*i and so on. Then you also have the *complex numbers* which are made up of *both* real & imaginary parts - things like `(2.5 + 3i)`. Really, anything of the form `(a + bi)` where a & b are real numbers."
How odds work if everything is random?,"Odds basically tell you that if the exact same situation were to occur an infinite number of times, what portion of those times would lead to that specific result. e.g. If you have the Ace of Hearts, King of Hearts, Queen of Hearts and Jack of Hearts in your hand and 48 shuffled cards in front of you, there is a 1 in 48 chance you will end up with a 10 of hearts for a Royal Flush. There is no way of guessing which card will come up next, but if you shuffled that deck drew a card (made note of which card it was, replaced it and repeat) millions of times, you would get the Royal Flush 1/48 of the time. A pro would make that bet if it pays better than 48 times their money. They will only win 1/48 of the time, but if they get the chance to make that bet many many times in their lives, the rare win will make up for the cost of the losses."

"What would be the simplest way to ""unplug"" the internet, causing total shut down by means of disabling hardware?","Like, in your house? Or the whole thing? In your house, just unplug the cable between the router and the modem.  The Internet as a whole is so resilient (it was intended to survive nuclear strikes) that it would be extraordinarily difficult. Global thermonuclear war might do it."

"How my wife and kids would go about inheriting things that are only in my name like bank accounts, house, ect..","By default, after you die, everything will go to your legal next of kin. That person (or persons) is defined in this order, and if you don't have a living member of each group, it passes to the next one down: Spouse Children Parents Siblings I believe that next comes grandkids, then grandparents, but don't quote me on that. So if you don't have a spouse, but you have 3 kids and 2 parents living, your property would be split between your kids by default. And they'd inherit debts and things as well. A will exists to change these defaults. Say you have a spouse, but you still want to make sure that certain things go to your kids, your will would enumerate ""Hey, my kids get this, this and this, and my spouse gets whatever I didn't list."""
What is my all carbs/protein diet doing for me?,"Weight gain is dependent on calories in and calories burned. It doesn't matter where you're getting those calories from, if you burn them all through activity and lifestyle, then you're not going to put on weight. Olympic Swimmer Michael Phelps ate somewhere around 2000 Calories for breakfast (remember watching a documentary - his breakfast had eggs, bacon, sausages, waffles with syrup, etc). My only concern about your diet would be that your lack of fruits and vegetables could mean you're risking various vitamin deficiencies such as Vitamin C, A, B12, K, etc. Not to mention you might not be getting that much fibre and depending on what exactly it is you eat, your cholesterol level could suffer."
Are calories just calories? Is it the same if you get a calorie from a fizzy drink or a piece of fruit or a slice of potato or a bit of cheese?,"A calorie is a physical measure of energy - specifically, the amount of energy needed to heat one metric mililitre of water by one degree Celsius. Energy in food intake is also measured in this way, though the terms kilocalorie and calorie are often used interchangably, which can cause confusion.  But yes, no matter where it comes from, one calorie always represents the exact same amount of energy. However, a difference you *can* make is that some foods will allow the energy that is within them to be absorbed more efficiently or more quickly, which can lead to varying results. (Edit courtesy of Neo6874: One calorie heats one millilitre by one degree Celsius. One kilocalorie heats one litre by one degree Celsius.)"
"Why do computer telephone response systems always ask me to type a bunch of info, then transfer me to a human who asks for the exact same info?",I used to work for costumer service and we do this to make it an unpleasant experience for the costumer so that they never call again. It's the same concept as those In-mail rebates that tend to be annoying to complete. That's why I ended up quitting. I didn't like the whole idea of treating the customers bad.
"Why is it that lakes/ponds around the world have fairly similar fish, instead of them each having their own unique species of fish like land ecosystems do for animals?","The water in the lake came from somewhere. Most lakes are fed by rivers and streams, or were originally parts of a river network as is the case with [oxbow lakes.](_URL_0_) A lake that was completely isolated from any other sources of water would eventually see evolutionary divergence if it had unique stressors, but there aren't many, if any, lakes like that, at least aboveground. Also a lot of lake and river fisheries are stocked by humans. Like, you'll find largemouth bass in a lot of fisheries around the world, it's especially popular in Japan, but largemouth bass are only native to North America. They were artificially introduced to fisheries elsewhere."
How bars or clubs charge huge crowds of people randomly ordering drinks.,"people either start a tab or they pay up front. it's part of a bartender's job to make sure they get paid for their goods/services. i'm sure some bars and bartenders will allow regulars to get away without paying upfront in certain scenarios, but that really depends on the business and employees."
Why group mentality is so powerful,"Human nature to belong and conform to social groups, empathy, and natural fear of exclusion. It's kind of instinctual, that's why the weak minded are susceptible to group mentality. Case in point: Reddit."
"If each pixel is merely a combination of a red, blue, or green light, why don't colorblind people who can, for example, not see red or green colors, only see blue on computer monitors?",It's not that colour-blind people can't see red or green. They can see them both fine; they just can't tell them apart.
"The Hateful Eight in 70mm, is there no way to replicate so every theatre gets that ""visual effect""?","Gonna get a little technical:    The movie has a digital equivalence of around 8192x2968 (assuming a 4K equivalence for regular 4-perf 35mm). I don't know of any theater that has a projector above 4K, many are even at 2K (2048x1080, almost the same as regular 1920x1080, as most movies are 2K).   So, seeing it in a theater with 4K projection is the next best thing (at basically 50% the ""resolution"").   Movies like Interstellar, The Dark Knight, Star Wars Ep VII (only one scene though), etc. are even bigger because they are 70mm IMAX, which is around 11800x8192. I saw both Interstellar and Star Wars Ep VII in this format and it what great, Interstellar took the cake though in terms of how amazing it was visually/immersively."
How does a watch know when a month has 30 or 31 days?,"I think you have to manually adjust it every time the month changes, but not sure, sure someone will correct me."
Why does tiredness feel as though it comes in waves?,"Biorhythms. Your body has cycles: breathing, heartbeat, blinking, even which nostril you use. Your wakefulness/tiredness is also cyclic."
how does your brain produce a coloured image through staring at a negative?,"Your eye sensors tire after a short while viewing a static image. In this example they're giving you a fixed point to focus on so that the image stays positioned in the same place on your retina. Notice how her lips are green in the negative. Staring at that wears our your green sensor there. Then, when you switch to look at white (which contains red, green and blue) your eye's red sensors work but the green, temporarily, do not. So you see red lips."
"Why are most passwords hidden on-screen by default when you type them, but WIFI passwords are not?","Most on screen passwords are hidden in-case you have any shoulder surfers(people watching you type over your shoulder). WiFi passwords give you the option to either hide or show, in my opinion as WiFi passwords are normally longer than other account passwords they can be hard to make sure your typing correctly without seeing it"
Why does time use the number 60?,"60 is easy to divide cleanly in multiple ways, and a number based on 60, such as the number of degrees in a circle, can be divided yet more ways. 60 can be divided by 1,2,3,4,5,6,10,12,15,20,30 and itself. This provides many easy-to-reckon, useful fractions. In the days before pocket calculators, slide rules, Napier's Bones, etc. this made life simpler."
The true difference between i5 and i7 processors,"ELI5 is not really the right place to get the help you are looking for, u/bendvis gave a great answer to i5/i7 but that does not answer the questions you don't know to ask yet. To add some answers about the rest of the system, you really want to educate yourself before rushing out to buy that shiny i7 and 1080ti, you should check out r/buildapc.   You say you want to build for gaming and video production. What kind of gaming? Is it match 3 clickers or you trying to play ArmA? The hardware you choose depends on the task. What sort of videos are you producing? Gaming youtube stuff or you rendering output from a high end camera? You will want different hardware if you are streaming vs local recording. What sort of budget are you working with? All these questions are asked and answered all the time at r/buildapc. Welcome to PC, it is not supposed to be easy because that is no fun."
Why does water taste bitter after eating pineapples?,"When the water hits your taste buds, they are stimulated a little. The problem is they have been overloaded with sugar and acid, thus they are temporarily unable to *report* sugar and acid at that moment. Therefore they report the only thing left: alkaline (bitter) taste. Add that to the fact that most water has dissolved minerals in it that make it ever-so-slightly alkaline."
how a drug goes from needing a prescription to being able to buy it without a prescription,"Like you're five? Because the grownups who make the drug (Sanofi) showed the grownups who regulate the drug (the Food and Drug Administration) that the drug is safe enough to take without needing the advice from a doctor. The drug itself does the same thing only now you don't need a prescription from the doctor. People get easier access the the medicine, the drug company gets to sell a lot more drugs, and pharmacies make more money because they're selling more OTC items. For more see _URL_0_"
How do cars calculate speed and preview it on the speedometer?,"**NOT ELI5** The car's driveshaft also powers a *speedometer cable*, which spins a magnet around at the same speed inside the *speed cup*. This magnet rotates continually in an equal direction. This spinning creates a fluctuating magnetic field. The laws of electromagnetism dictate that a current must therefore flow inside this cup. This current causes the speed cup to also rotate. It attempts to catch up with the speed of the magnet. a *hairspring* stops this, so it only rotates a little. This small motion moves the dial on the speedometer a little. The stronger the current, the faster the cup rotates, the further the speedometer's dial moves.  & nbsp; **ELI5** The driveshaft powers a speedometer cable, which leads to a magnet rotating inside a cup. A current is generated, and the cup tries to rotate also. A spring limits this, moving the dial. More current = more speed = dial moves further."
What would happen if we could drill a hole to the core of the Earth?,"The Earth is molten beyond the crust, so we wouldn't get any further than that."
Is there a psychological term for when you finish a game/book/series and feel empty inside?,"""Ennui"" (pronounced ""on-we"") is a pretty close fit. Also, it's French and they're very good at feeling empty and dissatisfied inside.  ennui: 1. a feeling of utter weariness and discontent resulting from satiety or lack of interest; boredom:"
"Why is it, that even though I genuinely love Whiskey, I shudder nearly every time I drink some?","Your conscious brain loves it, but your subconscious brain realizes that alcohol is inherently bad for the body, and causes you to shudder. It's a subconscious survival mechanism that you're overriding with your conscious brain."
Why is it when I drink a glass of liquid I urinate at least twice as much back out?,"Your bladder only sends the ""time to pee"" message to your brain when it reaches a certain level of fullness. So the amount you pee out doesn't just represent the glass of water you just drank, but all of the water you have drank since the last time you peed plus the water your body needed to dissolve the waste products it excretes in urine (urea, creatine and some other compounds)."
What prevents DNA from getting tangled?,"Proteins!  There are *many, many* proteins in your body that have a specific job of keeping your DNA tangled/condensed the perfect amount. There are topoisomerases, a family of proteins, that specifically twist/untwist your DNA to introduce/remove ""supercoils"" (like what would happn when you twist an elastic band) to condense it or expand it. There are some proteins like histones to which the DNA will almost always be attached. The histones kind of serve as a backbone for the DNA; a place for the DNA to organize itself.  Of course, this is just the very basic level of proteins. There are many more proteins and ways to organize DNA. It's always proteins!"
Why does the tray in a microwave rotate?,Because there are hot and cooler spots due to the way the microwaves reflect around inside the oven. Rotating the food attempts to distribute the heat in the food more evenly.
why child support is based on income rather than what a child would need monthly.,"Child support is partially based on income. It is also partially based on the number of children and their age, the cost of basic living expenses and school in that general area, and whether or not any special needs are present. Which sometimes leads to a very high ratio, but that is also something that can happen when both parents live with their children; not all jobs pay a wage that covers a child's reasonable expenses. That doesn't mean those expenses don't occur though."
"If you had a room with all walls, the floor, and the ceiling made of perfect mirrors and you shined a light in there somehow, would the light continue in there forever? Would it somehow disappear?",Nothing is a perfect mirror. The material still ends up absorbing some of the light. Eventually it would all get absorbed.
It seems like the whole world is against George Lucas' remade and remastered version of the Original Star Wars trilogy. What exactly did he do to change the story that makes fans hate it so much? Why all the vitriol?,"As Pandromeda mentioned, Han Solo fired first. Also, he added in a bunch of CG aliens that didn't fit, put back in a deleted scene with Jabba the Hutt that wasn't necessary, added cheesy special effects to the Death Star explosion, added in a fucking song and dance number to Return of the Jedi, replaced the original ending of Jedi and added in Hayden Christiansen. He basically tinkered with it unnecessarily and added in a bunch of crappy looking CG aliens and effects. edit: cheese=cheesy"
How do blankets work? Why do they allow me to become warm even when the outside is cold?,your body makes heat. this warms the air around your skin. the blanket holds that air close to you.
"Why does the media spend so much time covering the question of whether or not Jeb Bush can rise in the polls, but doesn't extend nearly that level of coverage to other non popular contestants?","Jeb Bush is considered (generally) the primary establishment candidate, which means he's expected to have significant political clout with the republican party. Alternatively, he's also a Bush, which means he's entangled in a lot of familial controversy, 'Bush Dynasty' 'Can George Bush's brother win after his unpopularity?' sort of stuff. Both attract interest, which the media wants in order to get paid."
The different between Sunni and Shi'ite Muslims.,"Shi'ites think that leadership in Islam should be hereditary, and that Imams more or less represent the authority of the founder through his bloodline. Sunnis think that leadership in Islam should be by some sort of democratic process, and you don't need to be a descendant of the founder to hold authority. It started out that way when the movement had to decide on how to continue after the death of its founder. Pretty soon, through in-fighting and because that is the way things go in a closely knit community, everybody and his uncle also had an opinion that would be forced upon the community. There is a Wikipedia article that goes into the various branches of islam in more detail: _URL_0_"
Why did film become a synonym for movies when photography also used film?,"It depends on the context, but I'll stick to your examples. People didn't view still photographs on photographic film. They needed to be printed on photographic paper. Slides are an exception, but they didn't get popular until later.  Motion picture film is negative and printed onto another piece of film to make a positive for viewing via a projector. Many people view magnified motion picture film, but most people never view still photo negatives.  This is may not be the etymology, but it makes sense, and that's what your looking for."
The core beliefs of American political parties.,"This is a difficult question, America is insanely vast. A Republican in New York is going to be much different from a republican in Texas. A democrat in California will be different from a democrat in Michigan. Any person that wants to run for major office with a likable chance of winning usually has to run under one of these two parties, recent example: Bernie Sanders.  The idea is Republican is generally more conservative, pushing for no economic regulation but social restrictions. Democrats are generally more Liberal pushing for zero social regulation but economic and business restrictions."
How do broadcasters sell and maximize advertising revenue during live sports when they don't know how many commercial breaks there will be?,"For American football games they know within one or two how many breaks there will be. On between possessions they will radio down and stop lay during the break a ""TV timeout"" and a dude in a bright colored red or yellow jacket will come out and stand with the ref until it is time to resume play."
"Why when we are sick/have an infection does our body temperature go up, as in a fever?","Many infections grow best at particularly precise temperatures. Your body raises your temperature as a defense mechanism, slowing down the reproduction of the infectious agent and giving your own defenses a chance to 'catch up'. At the same time it enhances the ability of some of your body's defenders to move around more actively in their war."
Why do real almonds not taste like almond paste/flavoring?,"The almond flavour you taste in almond paste, marzipan and so forth comes from an aromatic called benzaldehyde. This is found in *bitter* almonds, which also have a fairly hefty amount of cyanide; the latter is removed during the extraction of the benzaldehyde. The almonds you eat in nut form are *sweet* almonds, which contain a much lower level of benzaldehyde, and, luckily enough, cyanide as well. Benzaldehyde is also present in apricots, cherries, and peaches, which is why they all have similar taste profiles."
Why haven't people as a whole adapted to the cold? We have adpated to the sun by the pigment in our skin changing colour depending on your exposure to sunlight.,"Human's primary form of adaptation is the use of technology. So we have adapted to the cold by inventing insulated shelter, controlling fire, and making clothing."
"When I swallow a pill, why is there sometimes a heavy feeling in the back of my throat?","I used to get that feeling a lot when I first started taking my daily pills. Turns out I wasn't getting the pill ""stuck"" in my throat exactly, but I was not swallowing them with enough water.  When someone swallows pills without proper salivation or lubricant the object can ""scrape"" itself on the back of your throat, leaving you with that heavy and sometimes painful feeling that doesn't go away for a while. It may feel like it's lodged in there, which could be possible, but it's most likely just pain from the pills contact.  Long story short, always drink water before and with pills."
"Why is Reddit valued at ""only"" ~$1.8 billion, when less popular sites (e.g. Twitter) are worth many times more?","Reddit isn't publicly traded (there hasn't been an IPO yet), so speculation can't inflate the value of the company like Twitter or Tesla. A company is basically worth how much people are willing to pay for shares of it, but you can't buy shares in Reddit yet. It's also not profitable, yet, which doesn't help."
How can there be a sex wage gap in the US if we've had the Equal Pay Law since 1960?,"There's a bit of a misconception about the wage gap. For jobs in the exact same role with the exact same responsibilities, the wages are about the same. However, men tend to be more likely to be promoted to higher-paying positions. Women are also more likely than men to take extended time off or work part time while raising a family, meaning their careers are held back during that time."
How can electric motors for cars be small enough to fit into a car and relatively cheap while industrial electric motors with similar power and torque are the size of a kitchen and cost more than an electric car?,"Industrial electric motors are meant to be run nearly 24/7 at higher loads and don't have to be portable, so size isn't usually a factor as much as keeping them cool, so they're built to shed excess heat better, and more surface are = more heat that can be transferred away. on the other hand for cars, weight and size are bigger factors, and the motors in them will never be run full power all the time, so more effort is put into them to keep them smaller. Heat dissipation isn't as much of a problem either in a car as you can use the cars air flow to help keep things cool, whereas industrial motors don't usually sit in well ventilated areas."
"Why are sunglasses universally considered ""cool""?","people use their eyes to communicate their level of comfort/aggression/submission with one another. shades will remove this information and allow others to fill in the blanks. for example, you might be avoiding eye contact, but because of your sunglasses this does not register with people and you seem undeservingly ""cool"""
What is the difference between quality sushi and regular sushi?,"Fresh vs. Frozen - was it alive this morning?  The Chef's reputation and experience - you're buying his car!  The ambience isn't free, if you're having sushi at a Chinese buffet, it's mostly fake crab and Thai illegal immigrants doing the work.  The exact kind of fish! You're not going to find supermarket fish at the Sushi-is-us hole in the wall. If you want the whole range of selection, you need the real Sushi Bar."
Why do American cities often have to take large public transport projects such as light rail and metro system to the voters but don't have to do the same for massive highway and road construction?,"Large road projects usually exist to keep the existing road network running, or to improve its relation to the rest of the city. Bridges need to be retrofitted, underpasses capped, tarmac replaced. They may be big projects, but they're really necessary to keep the system functioning like it is. A major public transportation network is an entirely new investment. If you don't do it, you don't it--there's no downside other than that you don't have the network. A comparable project would be the construction of an entirely new highway link (or in some cities, the removal of major highways), which is rare and nowadays often put to voters as well. Of note is that many major highway projects were initiated in a time when referendums for transportation were not as common."
How come bluetooth is so much slower than Wi-Fi?,"Bluetooth is designed to be short-range very low-power for small portable equipment. Part of the power-savings of Bluetooth come from diminished bandwidth (just as much as the weaker signal). One could speed up Bluetooth to Wi-Fi speeds, but then it would defeat the purpose of BT's major design feature. If you're looking for something that works like plunging a cable between devices but has Wi-Fi speeds, you might like wireless USB: _URL_0_"
How does the ISS avoid damage from solar wind's if it is always in constant orbit?,The ISS orbits beneath the protective shield created by the earth's magnetism. The bulk of the solar wind is deflected away from earth by the earth's magnetic field.
Why do we tear up when we yawn,"Not 100% sure if this is the correct answer, but the act of yawning presses against the glands which produce tears. These glands are like a sac, so pressing against these sacs make the tear flow regardless of if you need it or not"
"With the Separation of Pangea, how come we didn't evolve into several different species?","We weren't around back then. The continents were already in their present form when humans evolved (in Africa, almost certainly)."
How is Canadian healthcare different from Obamacare?,"Canadian healthcare is, more or less, single-payer. Basically, you pay a tax to the government and the government insures you. American healthcare is a big old mess. We have single-payer for some people (Medicare), full-on nationalized healthcare for some (the Veterans' administration, where doctors are government employees), private insurance for many, and no insurance (fuck you and die) for some.  Obamacare is actually working--it's fixing some of the worst problems with private insurance and reducing the number of people with no insurance. But our health care system is still a big old mess. Obamacare didn't create the mess, but it does sort of freeze it in place. If you want more detail, I created a comic to explain Obamacare here: _URL_0_."
Why do app developers like supercell release their updates/apps way earlier on one platform than the other?,"If you're referring to the time gap between Android and iOS releases, the answer is because of Apple. Things get on the Android market very easily and quickly, because the Android market is cool. Apple has dozens of excessive rules and guidelines that they strictly enforce, so they actually look through the app/code. This takes time, so they usually push the update to Android and iOS at the same time, and Apple takes forever to approve. edit: of course this doesn't mean that Android doesn't have or enforce guidelines. They just aren't ridiculous like Apple's."
"Why do the vast majority of good police officers and other form of L.E. protect the ""bad apples"" and not outcast/ help remove them?","Cop here. Truly ""bad"" cops don't want to get caught. If they're doing something shady, they're probably hiding it. A couple other factors: Police departments operate independently from one another.  I have nothing to do with the department in the next town over, let alone across County or state lines.  Even within the same department, you'll have your own beat. You'll go most of the day without interacting with your fellow officers.  I work in a department with over 1700 sworn officers. I see about 10 of them a day, and only 2 or 3 of them will I actuality go on calls with in my response area."
"If we were still at war with Nazi Germany, Nazi supporters would be tried for treason. Why now are Nazi groups aloud to persist, unchallenged by law?","Simply expressing support would not be sufficient to try someone for treason even back in war times. That would be deeply unpopular, but not treason unless you'd do something *material* in regards to the enemy war effort. For example, you can look at organizations like German American Bund or British Union of Fascists. In general, their organized activities were prohibited during the war and leaders were detained for various issues; but the detained people, as a rule, were not tried for treason and the vast majority of their members (tens of thousands of them!) weren't tried for anything ever."
Why is pencil graphite referred to as Lead instead of graphite?,"Before chemistry was really a thing, everyone thought that graphite was a type of lead, probably because it's so soft."
"Why are the words ""Yeah"" and ""Oh"" always in pop songs and said for so long?","They are used as *filler* where the tune requires a note, but the singer doesn't have anything more to say. An excellent lyricist will try to adjust the wording so that not too many of these are needed."
"Where does color goes when the sun ""bleaches"" it?","It breaks the molecules that make the color, and the byproducts don't have any specific color. The atoms are still there, but formed into different molecules."
Why does my phone echo sometimes?,issues with the line. there is noise on the line when you call. when you hang up an phone it makes a new connection and this time no issue with the connection.  it can be either the person you call or your phone line causing this issue
Why does inbreeding cause the offspring to have a significantly lower IQ than average? What is the science behind it?,"take it that a human body has 2 sets of genes. When a baby is made, half the genes are from the mother and other half is from the father. These genes make proteins which help our body work. However, there are occasionally some errors in the genes which ends up making defective/too much/too little proteins which give rise to diseases.  Some of these diseases require 2 faulty set of genes in order to manifest. So if daddy has a defective gene but mommy contributes a normal set, the disease does not manifest clinically (or is milder). If there are many generations of inbreeding, the set of defective genes are kept within the same family tree; there is no new genetic input from a different family and thus the probability of having a child with 2 sets of defective genes increase. This increases the risk of diseases, out of which some may feature a lower IQ/brain malformations."
"Why is it that after waking from a bad dream, even though I am awake and aware that the dream was not real, I am still irrationally freaked out and disturbed by the events of the dream for a good amount of time?","If you are having a scary dream your body may start producing Adrenaline, or other hormones that help you deal with stressful situations.  Even though you have woken up, those hormones are still active in your system and the heightened sense of awareness sticks around until your hormone levels return to normal."
Why can't modern houses be economically independent with solar + battery+ a little backup generator just incase?,"A) You need a large array of solar powers to provide full coverage to the home (large initial cost, requires a lot of surface area, potentially takes away from the visual appeal of the home) B) until very recently, there hasn't really been any cost-effective battery solution for homes (Tesla Powerwall is helping to change this) C) Most people who live in developed countries don't have to worry about power outages because they are extremely rare. In these countries, it doesn't make sense to install solar panels just as an emergency backup... you would only do the install if your intention was to go off-grid so you don't have to pay a monthly electric utility bill (and/or because you can sell excess electricity back to the grid / power company to potentially earn money)."
"If we are 70% H2O, why are we considered Carbon based?",The chemistry that keeps us going is based on carbon-chain molecules.  We do use water for some reactions but most of it is just solvent for molecules to float around and react in.  It's somewhat like why we say tea is a plant-based beverage even though it's mostly water. The interesting part isn't the water.
Why do we have speed limits rather than a speed range?,"Because that's the top speed you can safely do, assuming ideal conditions (at least that's the premise). When it's raining, snowing, cold or dark, this changes it from being ideal conditions. It's not safe to drive at that speed any more. Worse it is, the slower you need to go, especially if your visibility is impaired. Too much variation in the weather to set a ""minimum speed"". Not sure about you are, but here there is a 5% tolerance on our 100kph speed limit - 105 before they'll ping you. (which quite funnily is, in mph, equating to 63mph in a 60)"
"can you explain the NFL lockout to me (what it is, why it happened, outcomes of it etc.) LI5","One answer can be found in the other thread created here  _URL_0_ As for the outcome, I haven't found much of a resource on what has been created but a few things like  Rookie Wage system has been set up so that draft picks will be paid a certain amount depending on where they were drafted.  I also believe the rights of refusal which is a teams ability to choose three of the teams free agents and match any offer given to them. So for example, if Chad Ochocinco was a restricted free agent looking for a team, and the New England Patriots agreed with Chad that they'd pay him 30 million for 2 years, the Bengals could match the pay and keep Chad despite him wanting to play for the Patriots.  Other outcomes include each team's salary cap for their players being 120 million. (the number might be wrong but that is one gist).  There are many more but those are the main ones I know of."
The world can't agree on standard units of measurement for anything except time. H ow come?,"They can and did. ISO standard units called the SI units. Most everyone doing serious business is using them for most everything and have been for a while, non-SI units are just used in day-to-day stuff because people have preferences and it's generally not worth it to, for example, force Canadians to actually measure their mass in kilograms."
We all mostly skip or block ads. What makes companies still believe online ads like on youtube is worth investing?,"""We"" is comprised of tech-savvy desktop/laptop users. Mobile users and most internet users don't use adblock, and their revenue makes it worthwhile."
Can someone explain what quantum suicide and quantum immortality are?,"Some people think that when something happens, new versions of reality are made, one for each possible outcome of the thing happening. For example, you flip a coin. In one universe, the coin comes up heads. In another universe it comes up tails. Now say you decide to kill yourself. You get a gun and point it at your head and pull the trigger. In one universe, it goes off and you die. In another, the gun jams and you live. Since the only universe you are alive in is the one where you live, you experience that universe. Therefore, according to you, you do not die. This happens every time you have a chance of dying. According to you, you can never die."
"Why is it that plants comparatively much less diverse (only ~250,000 species) than other clades of life?","I don't know for certain, but think about it: Plants are sedentary. They find a particular kind of environment that suits them well and, for the most part, stay in one place for their whole lives. They don't need to develop systems that allow for locomotion. They don't need to develop complex tissues and organs that make up that system, nor the vessels and oxygen transport mechanism to ensure the cells in the locomotion system stay energized. They don't require much energy since, again, they stay put; they make their own energy, and it's enough to get by on.  Much of the complexity of animal life revolves around how they tweak the basic mechanics of moving around. Where does it move? How does it move? What does it require in order to move? How much and what kind of energy does it need? Does it regulate its own internal temperature?"
Why do we randomly get this weird/burning sensation in the nose when inhaling?,Always assumed it was a dry spot where there was no mucous.
how do sinkholes happen,"Student Civil Engineer here. To put it as if you are actually 5. Imagine there is a road, now underneath that road there is soil. Over time water can erode (takes away) bits of soil. Over a period of time there is now no more soil under the road since the water has eroded it and there is just a big hole. Eventually the road cannot support its own weight and collapses into the empty space. This is a sinkhole. The reason why i said over time and over a period of time is because these can happen fast (during floods) or very slowly. A leak in a sewage pipe over years dropping small amounts of water every few minutes can still create a sinkhole. Hope this is helpful."
"Are mobile ads intentionally the last thing to load while opening a page, so more people would accidentally click them?","No. Ads are usually provided by a 3rd party company from their servers, not the same server that is delivering the rest of the content on the page, so they can often take longer to load compared to other stuff on the page.  They are often also image-heavy, which means they take longer to load than text. They are also usually inserted into the page using javascript, so that they can load several different ads to different viewers on the same page, or target ads to different users, or track impressions, & c. The script that loads these ads often runs after other content in the page has loaded, so that the page doesn't have to wait on the ads & just display as blank while the ads load (this would lose you a ton of visitors, & make the ads worthless because there'd be no visitors to see them once they do load)."
why are we producing more aluminium than we recycle if it takes 95 percent less energy to recycle?,"Yes, it would be, but then there would also be a finite amount of aluminum on earth and we would never be able to have more bottles and cans than we do right now. The world is growing and we still have a need for new aluminum. People like airplane manufacturers and NASA need lots of high quality aluminum so they are willing to pay for the good stuff, coke doesn't need anyhting other than tin cans so they likely wont pay a premium for new aluminum and jsut use the recycled stuff."
why are there no comedy categories at the Oscars,"Each awards show has their own thing. You're probably aware of the Oscars and the Emmy, but there are like a hundred others with their own style and categories.  However you're not alone in your thinking. Not having a separate comedy category has been a regular criticism of the Oscars. They tried to assuage this a bit (and add some flair and promo to the show) by upping the best picture category from 5 films to up to 10, hopefully to allow more diverse films outside of dramas (such as animated, comedy's, and sci-fi films), but this is still pretty new. They changed the voting on it a bit too, but its unknown if this had any effect on the eventual winners. In other words... this particular award show does its own thing, just like the others, and this does not seem like something they are particularly interested in."
"Why is it when I love someone a lot, that sometimes I have to hug them tightly and it feels like I can't be close enough.","No answer, but that is fucking adorable. I hope you two have a long happy life of being this in love together."
Why are the stairs of an escalator higher than the stairs of a staircase?,"To give you better timing to get off the step at the end, and to somewhat discourage you from running up them while moving (primarily for children)."
Why does half and half in containers not have to be refrigerated? How come it can be left out for days while milk has to always be kept cold?,Are you sure you're not referring to non-dairy creamers? Half and half most certainly needs to refrigerated.
Why are smoke shops allowed to sell bongs?,"Next time you go there, look for a sign. There will be one saying ""For Tobacco Use Only"" While bongs are commonly associated with marijuana, they are also used for tobacco and in that regard are perfectly legal. By saying they're only for tobacco it protects the stores from the drug laws you mention. So in order for there to be any legal consequences, people would have to prove that the shop is knowingly selling them for use with marijuana and not tobacco. This is impossible to prove in almost every case."
How does hot water work in hotels?,"While all buildings are a little different, most use a single boiler and a recirculating hot water system. Hot water circulates in big loops on each floor, driven by small magnetic pumps. This means the water is ""instant-on"". The storage tank is kept warm by the boiler and inflowing water is warmed before it goes into the tank. This provides constant temperature hot water all day."
How do pornography sites stay in business?,"For the same reason Youtube is allowed to exist. The law determined that these sites cannot reasonably be expected to control uploaded content to such a degree, in other words they cannot be held accountable for copyright infringement *as long as* they comply with DMCA requests and delete videos on demand. This does happen even now, I remember a certain popular account on xvideos/xhamster that got banned multiple times for example. The problem of course is that videos get uploaded faster than they can be taken down. Commercial porn sites probably have given up on that battle more or less and adapted. Instead, they release ""sample clips"" in order to advertise for their sites of full HD content. Those commonly 5-minute long vids are just small parts of hour long productions that you usually *don't* get to see."
"How am I a W-2 employee, yet do not qualify for any benefits, including unemployment? Details in comments.","It varies from state to state. One reason could be that you didn't earn enough in at least one of two consecutive quarters. Depending on exactly when your season ends, that could screw you. Or just simply not enough hours.  No matter what the reason, I think you're entitled to a hearing. I'm sure that varies as well, but it's worth looking in to. EDIT: To clarify, I believe this hearing is like an appeal. If you've applied and been denied, it's an opportunity to meet with whomever it would be and plead your case."
How come Humans can't learn animal languages and communicate to them?,"Because animals don't have language. They communicate emotions with sound like angry growls, panicked screams, horny rumbles, and affectionate purrs, but they can't communicate abstract thoughts, form sentences, assign arbitrary names to objects and events, combine terms to make new concepts, etc, which is what we consider language to be. A Mandarin-speaker and a Finnish-speaker can communicate anger and fear and happiness and affection perfectly well without using language, right? Just by sounds, tones, movements, facial expressions? Well, that's the level on which animals communicate."
"How and Why exactly does encryption work? Dont you need to transfer the key, and couldnt (lets say the NSA) not simply obtain it by saving all your internet activity?","Nope, because of the magic of asymmetric cryptography. The short version is that the key used to *encrypt* the data is not the same as the one to *decrypt* it. When Alice sends something to Bob, she encrypts it with his *public* key. This is a key that everyone has the right to see and access. Only Bob, who has the only copy of his *private* key, can then decrypt the message. He then sends a reply, encrypting with Alice's public key, and she decrypts with her private key. The same sort of thing happens with an SSL transaction (HTTPS). When you connect to a secure site, you know you have the right site because they have a certificate proving they are who they say they are. That certificate is also the public key, so you send the data encrypted with that key, and only that site can decrypt it. The site sets up a special session key to encrypt the rest of the data, so you and the site can continue to talk encrypted without anybody else being able to view the contents of the traffic."
What do degrees (temperature) actually measure?,"At a basic level you can think of temperature as the average molecular energy of a system. Temperature can be measured in different ways, but they all come down to measuring changes in heat energy (molecular motion and jiggling).  In everyday thermometers, what is measured is how a liquid (originally mercury) expands with temperature, travelling up the bulb. The expansion is due to the atoms in the liquid moving faster and pushing on each other harder.  In devices called thermocouples, the temperature affects how well a piece of metal conducts electricity, which can be measured precisely.  There are also infrared thermometers, which measure the heat energy in the form of light that objects give off. It's important to note that temperature isn't the same thing as energy, but the explanation requires delving into the wonders of thermodynamics, which is a bit too complicated for me to ELI5."
Why is it such a big deal that it costs more than 1 cent to make a penny? Shouldn't the cost and production of other coins and bills counteract the defecit of making pennies?,"Just because you CAN make up a loss in one are with a gain in another doesn't justify that loss. You could say ""sure, I throw away every other roll of toilet paper I buy without using it, but I buy toilet paper at half price."" Well, it would be better still to buy that half-price toilet paper and NOT throw any away. There are a lot of other good reasons to get rid of pennies, but I won't bore you by going into them here."
Why does yellow mustard taste so different from Dijon mustard?,Because its a different kind of mustard. Full of different... stuff.  Different *mustard stuff*.
Why are denim jeans both stiflingly uncomfortable in hot weather and freezing in cold weather?,When its too hot you will be hot in jeans. When its too cold you will be too cold in jeans.
the oligodynamic effect (i.e brass doorknobs disinfecting themselves after a period of time),"It's a fancy name for a simple concept. Atoms of heavy metals interfere with certain enzymes and proteins -- molecules that cells need to live. In other words, the metal simply poisons the bacteria, mold, etc."
"I am short-sighted. If I look in a mirror which is close to my face, objects in the distance (in the mirror) still look blurry. Why?","A mirror is not a picture. Put your camera in selfie mode and you will see the background in focus, because the camera in your phone is properly focused and the screen on your phone is a real image. The image in a mirror, on the other hand, is a virtual image made by reflecting light from the real world to your eyes. The distance to the objects in the scene is unchanged (maybe a little longer by the distance to the mirror and back)."
How do hair transplants work?,"Hair from the back and side of your own head is used. It's not affected by male pattern baldness. They take individual hairs or groups and place them on your bald areas. To get more complex, this hair is unaffected by DHT which causes MPB hair loss. Older techniques would use awkward looking groups of hair (ie hair plugs) while more modern techniques take smaller follicle groups harvest from a removed strip of scalp or device that takes individual follicle groups directly from the scalp (called Follicular unit extraction, or FUE).

Do water filters (like those placed in Brita water pitchers) really make a substantial difference in the quality of the water?,"Lots of people out there live outside of cities, they have water softeners, etc. But still the water is skanky and nasty. So, the britta filter comes to the rescue! It removes sulfer, iron, calcium, nitrates, and other nasty tasting stuff.  In 3rd world countries they have similar things with silver membranes to kill nasties. Such as the Tata Swach. _URL_0_ The also have micron filters, UV lamps, and various other gizmos."
Why some people would rather help an animal than a human?,"Speaking personally, animals seem more helpless and innocent. I feel like a human could help themselves in a way that a cat or dog couldn't, hence the animal is in greater need of help."
Why are second (and if lucky) third orgasms in a sex session (with a partner or alone) less intense than the first?,"That's funny, my second ones are always way more intense."
"Air pressure in houses? Why do some doors hit a cushion of air when they close, some doors slam when they close, and some doors get sucked closed?",It's depends on how air tight the room is. You will notice this with doors that are tighter to the carpet and not under cut. Take a door that you can't slam because of this and open a window in that room the air will be forced out the window and the door will close easier. Opening or closing a door rapidly will generate lots of air movement. Without somewhere to go it will be more difficult to close. Undercut doors allow air underneath. Similar to Windows letting air outside. Also to note in commercial buildings many glasses enclosed rooms and others have what's called transfer air duct that as well as allowing air out functionally assist in the same way. Source union sheet metal worker. Duct work.
Why do such well-known companies as McDonald's and Coca-Cola pay tens of millions to be the lead sponsors of the World Cup/Olympics/etc.? Do people really not know these companies at this point?,"A part of it is about securing future customers through positive association. If you are 5 y.o. and love football, and everytime you watch it on tv a big coca cola logo is burnt into your retinas, then you're more likely to prefer it once you're older and actually have some disposable income. Thats the idea, anyhow..."
The number system of Graphics Cards,"There essentially isn't one. Within an individual product line from a given manufacturer the numbers may mean something, but mostly they are just the name the manufacturer gave to that video card. It's all about marketing. The first number in most cards indicates the ""generation"" of video card they belong to, but this is still just marketing. A higher number doesn't necessarily mean more performance. A high-end GTX 6xx card might outperform a low-end GTX 7xx card, for instance. Basically, you have to look at the charts. The numbers are made up to sell more video cards, not to be informative in any way."
"Why can I hear a TV from another room, even if the volume is off?","Although I can't understand what you're saying in the explanation, I think I know what your'e talking about. Old TVs emit a very high frequency noise that is constantly on, even with the volume muted. you might be hearing this from the other room."
"What does ""single payer"" mean in the american health care system ?","""Single Payer"" means that there is a single entity that handles all of the insurance payments to medical providers. In this case, that payer would be the government. Instead of multiple private insurers that each cover a small portion of the population and each negotiate their own prices for procedures... we would have one big insurer that covers everyone and negotiates in behalf of everyone for lower prices on procedures. This would allow for lower and more fair pricing as well as universal coverage regardless of wealth or pre-existing conditions."
How is mass extinction humans fault?,"> Considering most people at that time and prior loved in mud huts HA! Humans had already been farming for 9,500 years, living in cities for most of that, China had been a sprawling empire for 4,500 years, Rome had risen and fallen.  Just because we hadn't built a steam engine yet didn't mean we weren't causing change to the environment on a massive scale, and had been for ages. And one of the biggest ways was with our stomachs - it's likely that human hunting played a major role in the disappearance of all the megafauna species in the new world, starting perhaps 10- to 20,000 years ago."
"How are branded drinks mass produced? (Gatorade, Monster)","There are huge companies out there that you have probably never heard of that make all different components of food and drinks. This includes flavor companies, food coloring companies, salt... pretty much every component on the back of the can was produced by someone else besides the one actually making the drink. So then gatorade has research facilities, pilot plants(kinda like a small scale plant to do trial runs, experiments on a bigger scale) and full scale industrial plants. The researchers figure out the exact formula they want for a product, it gets scaled up once for the pilot plant so they can figure out how to mass produce it and get the engineering kinks worked out and then it goes to full scale production. At the plant, they have filtered water that mixes with either a concentrated syrup or powder and then its pumped into cans or bottles. Then CO2 can be added and it is sealed and labeled."
what's an API? (computers),"It's an ""application programming interface"". It's a defined set of methods by which you interface with functions and data of a program from another programmer. E.G. google's API would allow me to submit (programmatically) a string as a search and get back a dataset of results that include descriptive text and url."
Why are Japanese fan content creators so much more strict about their activities in order to avoid copyright issues than Western fan creators?,"Social responsibility. In general, Japanese culture has a bit more sense of morality in respect to the original creators. They don't want to hurt the creators. Theres also this sense in Japan of following the order of things just for the sake of the law. A lot of westerners will do things they know they aren't supposed to, if they think they can get away with it. Japanese I think are more likely to take the ""safe"" road.  Lots of generalizations here, but I think it mostly holds true."
The difference between a parody and a satire,"Parody is imitation. Satire is humorous, constructive, social criticism."
"How come—when looking at the light produced on earth VIA satellite imagery, they are always yellow, when in fact, there are lights of all different colors being produced?","It's not VIA, it's just via, a word. :-) Anyhow, the answer is simple: most electric lights are actually yellow, so when you look at a lot of lights grouped together from far away, you see mostly yellow light."
"Why is insurance handled by private, for-profit companies rather than by the government?","> and that's definitely not who I would want backing me if I get in an accident. ...except that, unless you were criminally stupid when signing a contract, in this particular case you get to sue them, i.e. get the government involved. Under capitalism, the government is the policeman, not the entire economy."
How do tunnel builders know where they are going?,"i dont know anything about that specific project, but in general there is an engineer that surveys in the centerline of the tunnel using a theodolite (_URL_0_). you basically move a known point down the tunnel using the previous point along the centerline as a reference. you offset each point from the actual centerline so that you can mark the actual points with a nail along the tunnel wall, out of the way."
How exactly do Saline pools work?,"Salt water pools still use chlorine, the difference is that the chlorine is produced through electrolysis using the salt as the base material. The advantage is that the salt electrolysis process creates free chlorine ions (the type of chlorine that kills bacteria) and burns off chloramines (the type of chlorine that burns your eyes and smells like strong bleach). As long as they are maintained they will work just as well at killing bacteria, and people tend to find them less irritating, especially if they have sensitive skin. The salt system also has the benefit of ""softening"" the water. They tend to have a higher initial setup cost though, and saltwater is more corrosive than freshwater so you have to keep an eye on the internals and plumbing of the filtration system."
"Why did I just pay $250 for a passport with a 3-week turnaround, when a driver's license is $25 and take 30 minutes?","A driver's license is a state-issued document accepted by state governments certifying your identity and ability to drive.  A passport is a federally-issued document accepted by international governments certifying your identity and travel eligibility and history.  Whereas you can get away with a temporary driver's license printed on a DMV receipt printer, a passport has a LOT of liability tied to it and basically is your country insuring you as ""This person is a Normal Person""  The cost comes from the legal backing, as well as whatever background checks they need to run on you"
"Why is financing a car through a bank cheaper than financing through the dealership, even though dealerships have lower interest rates?","Quite often, its not. Many times you can combine a rebate with incentivised financing and end up much cheaper than your bank. For example, my wifes 2012 altima is currently financed at 0.5 percent and we bought it several thousand below invoice due to rebates/dealer incentives. No banks/credit unions were anywhere close at the time. The cheapest was around 4% at the time. Where dealerships get you is with all of the add-ons like extended warranties, window etching, undercoats, etc and you will get offered those regardless of whose financing you use."
how come we don't yet know the perfect diet for humans?,There isn't one. It would vary person to person and even to some degree day to day per person.
Why do aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights?,"> Why do aeroplanes/airplanes have headlights? Aircraft commonly land at night when it is dark. Being able to see the ground when coming in for a landing is important because they need to touch down at a reasonable speed. So not to put too fine a point on it, they are so the pilots can see when it is dark. You know, like with regular car headlights."
Why do i sleep better when its cold?,"The temperature that your body sleeps at is lower than the temperature your body maintains the rest of the day, this is for energy conservation and obviously to let your body rest. Simply put, keeping the temperature in your room lower may help your body to achieve this lower resting temperature. This makes falling asleep and staying asleep easier."
How does a contagion spread from contact with an open wound to the target organ in the body ?,"Generally through the blood stream or the lymphatic vessels. When a contagion attacks a specific organ I.e. Hepatitis, it is because something about those cells allows that particular pathogen to attack/reproduce better than they do in other cells. They don’t move towards that organ specifically, they just keep getting pumped through the bloodstream until they find a good place to start reproducing, or they’re killed by the immune system"
"Why can some people smoke and never get addicted, while other are addicted for life?",Not everyone is equally susceptible to addiction to cigarettes. I can chain smoke for a few weeks and then just stop for a few weeks without it being an issue. I'm not sure why that is true for me but its possible it may be because I was around second hand smoke a lot as a child.
Why do trained muscles get more volume rather than density?,"They get both volume and density, but there's an effective limit on how dense muscle tissue can be since it still needs to move and breathe and heal. There's less of a limit on volume, and it's also more visibly noticeable."
"In US, when a city is divided into two states, if a crime occurs in a part of city and the criminal is caught in different part of city, Is he also violated Federal Interstate laws?","Only if he committed the crime across the line. For example, if I knock over a Quickie Mart in KS, and then flee to MO I've only committed a crime in KS. If a kidnap a guy in MO and take him to KS now I've committed a crime in both states as well as federally. Its the cross-border nature of the crime that is important, not where the criminal is located. If I knocked over the Quickie Mart in KS *from* MO that'd be federal too. I don't know how I'd manage that though :P"
"what happened to the hole in the ozone? Did we fix it, is it still there, was it never that big of a threat?",We found replacements for chlorofluorocarbons and drastically cut down the rate at which we released them into the atmosphere. The holes are still there but have stopped growing and are on the path to recovery.
When I put pressure on my eyes for an extended period of time I see really cool patterns that alternate. What is that?,"your eye is full of liquid called the vitreous humour. when you press on your eyes, you're increasing the pressure of that fluid inside the eye; that in turn causes pressure to be applied to the nerves in the back of your eye, on your retina. those nerves get confused and start sending out random signals that you see as cool-ass patterns."
Why is Saudi Arabia an ally of the USA?,Saudi Arabia has oil and wants money.  USA has money and wants oil.  It's pretty much as simple as that.
How can Brick and mortar retailers continue to exist with online competitors,Somethings need to be touched or experienced.  They can also do onsite repair and warranty work for value add Value add is the key. The appeal to niche markets or do something that email and returns isn't quite comfortable Would you buy a house online?
Why does the shower water become hotter when someone flushes the toilet?,"your water heater heats water to anywhere from 120 to 180 degrees F. So in order to keep you from burning yourself cold water is mixed with the hot water to make a comfortable temperature. when a toilet is flushed it pulls a few gallons of water. thus, limiting the amount of cold water available to cool the shower."
"Do uncontacted tribes know we're here, like we are aware of their presence?","My impression is that most of them are aware that some kind of big, huge, technologically advanced world exists, but they don't know shit about it.  Commonly they are uncontacted because they want to be: being contacted tends to screw them over. (They flee from contact, or hear rumors from neighboring contacted tribes.) Either they have few useful skills and end up in the bottom of the heap of capitalism, or they get massacred by brutal 3rd-world mining and logging companies.  OTOH, they likely have very little idea of the scale or workings of industrial civilization."
Why can't we just gargle an antiseptic to get rid of a sore throat?,"Because the source of your sore throat is not lying around on the surface of your throat, but within the soft tissue surrounding it. Its like saying that washing your chest with a bar of soap should alleviate a chest cold."
"Why can't governments print ""temporary"" money to cover important expenses?","They do, and it causes inflation because the money doesn't have any material value behind it. Money is just something we use to represent value. Without creating the value, the printed money isn't anything more than paper, which in turn, makes every piece of money less valuable."
"Why can humans eat almost anything, yet so many foods like chocolate, grapes, and xylitol are dangerous for dogs and other mammals?","The premise of your question is basically flawed. We can't eat almost anything. About half of the red berries in existence are poisonous to us but not to birds, for example. The same is true about mushrooms. Also, not everything that is edible is food. Uncooked grains are edible, but you would eventually die if that's all you ate. OTOH, if you cook it into bread, you're pretty much good to go."
Why are Americans more or less complacent with the income inequality in their country?,"> It seems like people are ready to bitch about how somebody is literally Hitler for collecting food stamps  This is, unfortunately, the most successful way to *get* the extreme calcification of economies. When you blame the poorest and least powerful people for all the economic problems ('welfare queens') and put the rich on a pedestal ('job creators'), you get people fighting each other and ignoring the big issues. And because people are emotional, they want an enemy that is readily available and will make them feel good after getting some hits in on, not an enemy that appears untouchable and is difficult to have victories against. There are identity politics and self-worth issues at play here."
How are those huge cranes that work on skyscrapers setup/made taller/moved to really high floors?,"They're modular and self-assembling. The first structural piece under the rotation head, the lifter module, is more complex than the rest; it includes slides and jacks. The complete assembly process involves anchoring the base and setting up the horizontal arm. Once that's ready, the lifter module jacks up the head and the arm, and the crane lifts a structural segment off a truck and into place. Once the new segment is bolted in, the jacks retract and are bolted onto the new top structural segment. This process is repeated until the crane is as tall as it needs to be. Disassembly is the same process in reverse, with a caveat. If there is more than one crane involved, they may build around a crane within the building, so long as at least one crane is outside to lift out the pieces. The last crane, however, always has to have enough clear space to disassemble itself in the same process in reverse that it assembled itself with."
Why is cooking wine not regulated in stores like regular wine is?,Its not intended to be consumed as alcohol.  Vanilla extract is well known way for minors to get alcohol.
Why are Dolphins considered to be smart/advanced?,"They have communities, basic communication skills, they understand death, they have sex for fun and rescue creatures that are in danger."
"During the Middle Ages, what would happen if a country invaded another, and the invaded country couldn't afford to fight so it surrendered, but the invading country kept on fighting?","That's not really how treaties work. Treaties aren't like ""you get to keep all the land you've taken,"" they always specify very exact borders. If Country B truly had no will to fight, they would have given up all of their land (which is basically what an unconditional surrender is). If Country A didn't take advantage of the situation and got a treaty that wasn't as favorable as it could have been, tough shit; they should have thought of that before they signed the treaty. Of course, they could just break the treaty. There weren't any real international institutions in place to enforce that sort of thing, but you don't really make any friends with a reputation for breaking promises."
"How does the ""brace"" position in aircraft emergencies protect us?",The position places the body in a way where the damage to the body will be minimized.  _URL_0_ this is the result of not bracing. Bracing minimized the forces to the body
Why can certain types of batteries be recharged when others cannot?,Non rechargeable batteries are based on an chemical reaction that is not reversible. Edit: electrically reversible that is.
The US has more youth playing soccer than any other nation in the world. Why don't we have our own Messi?,"We have a lot of kids who play soccer, but the vast majority are in recreational leagues, not serious youth development programs like Messi went through. Those are growing along with the domestic league, though - the MLS Academy system just started four or five years ago."
"(As an American) Why is freedom of speech protected from the government, but not corporations?","The Freedom of Speech does not grant you the right to say whatever you want, whenever you want, it merely prevents the GOVERNMENT from restricting your right to free speech. When it comes to private institutions, they are free to set their own rules regarding things like speech, because you always have the option to not use them.  You are still allowed to keep your right to free speech, Tumblr is simply denying your ability to use THEIR website to do so."
"Cosplay; is it just done for an event? Does one wear their outfit on multiple, random occasions? Is it just made for the photos?","It's usually for a convention, which will run for several days. Some people wear the same costume to multiple conventions, others make a new one for each one."
"If there are concentration camps in North Korea that are similar to those found in Germany during WWII, why hasn't a military force such as NATO intervened?","This is asked a lot, but here it goes. North Korea would react violently if any force tried to offer aid to those in the camps. If North Korea acted violently, there would probably be a war. If there were a war, China would be upset. China doesn't want millions of refugees and nuclear radiation at it's borders."
Why is mercury the chosen substance for determining the temperature?,"We actually don't use mercury anymore, we use alcohol. But the simple answer is because as a liquid metal it is conductive, and expands and contracts predictably (importantly, linearly) with temperature changes. Further, unlike water, it's freezing point is low enough there is little change of that happening, and even if it somehow occurred it wouldn't make the thermometer explode as water would."
How do women's menstrual synchronize if they spend a lot of time together?,"They do not. It is a common misconception. They will occasionally *overlap*, in the same way as if you watch a bunch of cars with their blinkers on, but they don't synchronise."
I am confused about how many KB are in 1 MB. Some sources seem to say 1000 and others say 1024. Which is it?,"1024, 1000 is rounded out, u don't say ""hey that burger is 1,99"" you say: ""hey that burger is 2 dollars"""
please ELI5 what the sound is when i put a cup near my ear,"[Source](_URL_0_) The cup (or shell) amplifies the ambient noise, which is the thing you hear. Many people believe it's an echo of your blood, this can easily be disproved. Try to exercise and put the cup to the ear. The noise is no louder, even if you hearth is beating faster."
Why do you often feel to hot/cold when you want to sleep?,Your body temperature decreases to initiate sleep. The recommended temperature for a good night’s sleep is 60 to 67 degrees. That’s a lot lower than what I think most houses are at right now. So if your house feels too warm and you’re noticing it when you lay down for bed that’s probably why. I know the first sign every year for me to break out my a/c is when I lay down at night even though it was most likely hotter during the day
"Is it possible to make an app that is a scale for an iPhone? Since we have pressure sensitive touch, is there a reason we can’t have it measure just how much pressure for small items?","It is entirely possible and definitely a thing, such apps and sites did pop up when 3D touch became a thing with the iPhone 6 release, but IIRC Apple labeled the use of the phones in this way a liability and these apps were removed from the app store, but some websites are still around such as TouchScale."
"when is space where there is nothing but emptiness, what do rocket engines thrust against that make them move forward?","The rocket engines push against the exhaust that is being expelled. For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. It's exactly the same as if you were wearing ice skates (standing on ice, obviously) and holding a bowling ball. If you throw the ball forward, you'll slide backwards. This is not because the bowling ball is pushing against the air. It's because when you push the bowling ball forward, you're also pushing yourself backward. With a rocket, the exhaust from the engines is the bowling ball."
Why does the law allow companies to purchase or merge with other companies? Why aren't all purchases/mergers viewed as a consolidation within an industry and a step closer to monopolization?,Having a monopoly is not inherently bad or illegal. What is illegal is using your control over a market to stifle competition. That's when the government steps in and companies are broken up.
Why doesn't the United States FDA create a daily multivitamin they approve of?,"Vitamins are not food and they are not drugs. They cannot regulate them because currently they do not have the authority to do so. They (or some other part of the government, I am not sure) would have to reclassify all vitamins to make them a drug and therefore able to be regulated.  Edit: Also the FDA does not make any drugs, they regulate the companies that makes drugs. I am not sure how the FDA changing the classification of vitamins would magically make them more beneficial."
Why is Quebec still French speaking?,"> why is it the only French speaking region of Canada? It's not. It's only the only province where French speaking people are a majority.  > How come since Quebec was British owned and subsequently part of an independant Canada, English was not able to replace French? To avoid uprisings, the British accepted that it would keep its laws, language and religion thinking they would eventually assimilate. People decided they wouldn't and made efforts to preserve those. To this day, Quebec still works on a different legal system than the other provinces.  > Is French still realy the dominant language of Quebec? Yes.  > Do most people speak it there? Yes  > What are the languages though in school/shown on tv/ radio etc.? School teaches some English but not enough to qualify as bilingual. Media produced in Quebec are in French."
Why does rain make people tired?,"It's probably a combination of reasons. Humans like to be awake all day and sleep all night. And we take our cues from the sun. If it's raining it's darker, so our bodies think, hey almost time for bed! Let's get sleepy! The other reason is ( I'm not to sure about this one so other redditors feel free to debunk me! ): When we're in our mommy's belly we're constantly surrounded by the sound of her body, her digestive system gurgling but mostly the sound of her blood circulating. Which is a constant rushing sound. Rain kinda sounds like that, just like a rolling car, or vacuum cleaner. This makes us feel safe and comfortable. And again sleepy. Fun facts about this: If you drive a long way and don't have any distracting sounds like a radio the sound of your car can cause 'highway hypnosis' causing you to relax and fall asleep behind the wheel. Babies, when they're tired fall alseep very easily in the car or when a vacuum cleaner is running. Because it reminds them of being inside mommy's belly."
Why does smoking preserve food?,"Smoking by itself is actually insufficient to properly preserve foods. Smoke is an antimicrobial and an antioxidant but only protects the outside of food, so it is usually combined with other processes like salt-curing and drying which protect the interior of food from bacterial growth."
"Why when you stare at a moving pattern for an extended period of time and then look up, why everything's wavy.","This is due to how the movement is processed in the brain. Very basically, there are certain neurons that are firing in response to the moving pattern. The moving pattern is constant, so they are firing continuously. When you look away those same cells continue to fire because they've been doing so for however long you were looking at it. Your brain knows that the moving pattern is no longer in focus, but it still takes a bit to inhibit the neurons and stop them from firing. It's why optical illusions [like this one](_URL_1_) work."
Why are Saturday morning cartoons idealized? What’s so different about them as opposed to other days’ cartoons?,"Way back when there weren't multiple channels whose only purpose was cartoons. There was a MARKET for cartoons, but not a huge market. What day and time are kids most likely to be available year-round to watch things marketed towards them? Saturday mornings. During the week they're in school. Sundays, might have church. Later in the day Saturday, might have family activities. Parents might even try to sneak in a little sleep by sleeping until 8 or 9, and kids might be able to get up early and watch cartoons."
What is CERN and what real problems can it cause?,"CERN is basically trying to find out the origins of our universe and how everything works by using a very large particle accelerator to accelerate particles to 99.99991% the speed of light and have them collide with one another. When these particles collide they break apart and that is when we can see what holds particles together and how things work. Only problem is that there is years of data to go through and experimentally proving everything will take a long time.  There is no real threat from this, what you see online is just that, ""conspiracy theories."" People believing that smashing particles will create a black hole and destroy the world."
How can someone just walk away from a home loan?,"It's largely a US thing, and only in some states which consider mortgages to be a ""non-recourse debt"". The debt is secured on the property, but the borrower isn't personally liable for the debt beyond that security. If foreclosing and selling the property doesn't cover the full debt then the lender can't pursue the borrower further."
Why do we drink cow's milk instead of human milk?,"Human females can't produce the same quantities of milk that female cows can. It wouldn't be very profitable. Plus, notice that we mostly drink milk that comes from animals that like to graze on grass, like cows, goat, and sheep. Humans eat a lot of junk food and other stuff that doesn't make for very good tasting milk."
"In Sci-fi movies, why are alien organisms almost always silicone based?","Silicon is the other element other than carbon that would form long complicated bonds that life could evolve around. Though it is almost certain that another life form would be carbon based this gives a way of creating a ""totally new life form""."
"LI5, the current patent controversy between the top tech companies Google, MSFT, Apple, etc.","This doesn't directly address any existing lawsuits between those companies, though they are involved: you might find this episode of This American Life extremely useful in getting a better understanding of what goes on in patent law concerning software - I know I did: _URL_0_"
How are games cracked?,"The executable files of a game are basically just a bunch of machine code. Machine code are instructions executed by your computer.  By using a so called Dissassembler, you can turn the machine code into a somewhat human readable format called ""Assembler language"". If you are good, you can then analyse the code and modify to circumvent copy protection mechanisms, e.g. by taking the copy protection code out or jumping over it."
How carbon dating works,"Assume carbon ratios in living organisms within an environment are constant (perhaps it may vary for terrestrial vs. marine). The ratio only remains constant for that orgnanism while the organism is alive (just assume this is due to respiration). Any change in the ""known constant"" and the currently measured value yields a number of years since the organism died."
"Why is it taking them so long to come out with the oculus rift consumer version, when they developed it nearly a year ago, and came out with the development kits nearly two years before that?","My thoughts are because it is supposed to be a game changer(literally) and to release anything sub par could potentially hurt the concept and make it take even longer for people to get interested in it again, I for one would be extremely disappointed if it was clunky and didn't work as good as I'm imagining it will."
Why do different cheeses made from the same type of milk have different Calcium values?,It basically comes down to pH value of the whey and it's drained. Casein is bonded by calcium phosphate (which is where the calcium comes from) and as the pH decreases it becomes soluble and is drained away.
Why does water cause a near perfect hexagon bokeh on camera lenses?,"> Basically, how is this caused, and why the hexagon bokeh is always perfectly shaped? Both of those answers are because it is the shape of the lens aperture of the camera. [This link shows what structure is causing the shape.](_URL_0_)"
"How does insane Clown Posey have such large following, who are willing to do anything for the band?","Because persons are smart, people are dumb As some comedian said, imagine what average, I mean totally middle of the road intelligent, person is like.  Now realize that HALF the population is dumber than that."
- if pi is in between the number 3 and 4 how can it be infinite?,"It is *not* an infinite amount. It is less than 4. In *does* take an infinite amount of digits to explain precisely what the amount is, but that's about being precise, not about being huge."
ELI5:Why is it that a small animal will run up to a big animal and fight it and the bigger animal will run away? Do animals not know their size?,"Because the question in the wild is not so much if you win, but if you get injured. If the large animal stands and fights, yes, it might kill the small animal, but maybe the small animal takes a chunk out of the big animal's leg. Then the big animal has a gimped leg, can't run, can't catch prey (or escape other predators), and it likely dies."
How did the idea of weekends come to be?,"Henry Ford has been credited with creating the weekend as we know it today. Apparently the normal work week used to be six days, and Sunday was the day of rest. When Ford was paying workers $2 per day (maybe $2.50, not sure), the going rate at the time, there was lots of turnover and constant hiring and training, so Ford decided to double the rate to $5 per day to reduce turnover and keep employees instead of constantly training new hires. At the same time, he also decided to make a five day work week to give his employees Saturday off, thinking they would buy more cars to ride around in for the weekend. The local business community told him he would bankrupt his business. The day after he ran a full page ad in the paper for the $5 per day jobs, there were massive lines of people applying for jobs with Ford. The idea was extremely successful, and the weekend was born."
Why is there so much apparent public criticism against labor unions when they empower mostly low to middle income workers; who make up the massive majority of workers?,"The media is owned by corporate capital and has been shifting culture from progressive collectivism to ineffectual individualism for decades on purposes. The real opposition to Obamacare is not over its actual impact on the economy or personal freedom, it is about squashing any impulse towards collectivism or solidarity and replacing it with self-defeating individualism. ""Organized capital and vertical monopoly GOOD and organized labor BAD."" Progressive movements are floundering in iterative intersectionality and back-biting while capital prospers unopposed."
Why do doctors stop applying a defibrillator after a couple of tries?,"Same reason you don't keep turning the ignition key for hours in your car when it won't start -- there's no point in doing it, it won't get better."
How is it possible to program a computer? How can a clunk of metal understand lines of code?,Computers run off of binary code which is basically a bunch of 0's and 1's. So when you write a program in any programming language or in terminal/command prompt you are really just typing in a bunch of 0's and 1's that the computer can easily read.
How is it possible that we are able to find planets far away form the Earth (like Kepler-186 f or PSR B1257+12) but we don’t know if there are other planets in our solar system?,"The way we find these planets is to monitor the amount of light coming from a star and then see if it drops slightly occasionally. If it does then that means the star is partially obscured by a planet transiting across the front of it.  We do not have that perspective on planets beyond the orbit of earth as there is nothing bright for them to obscure. We cannot see them with telescopes because they are too dark and/or distant to detect, the best we can do is look for slight changes in the orbit of objects we can see (such as Pluto) to see if they are being affected by the gravity of something unknown."
"Smartphone ""rooting"" and ""crapware.""","""Crapware"" refers to all of the pre-installed apps that you don't want, but the device will not allow you to uninstall. ""Rooting"" means basically taking control of the device in such a way that you can do things that it normally doesn't permit you to do, including uninstalling ""uninstallable"" apps. The term comes from UNIX operating systems, where, aside from the normal user accounts, there is a ""root"" account that has absolute permission to do anything it wants, and will not be restricted in any way by the operating system."
; Bohr vs Einstein puzzle solution.,"The correct answer is that you have the same amount of B in A as there is A in B. Consider this: each container has 100 units of liquids A and B. The ladle can carry 10 units. In the first scoop, you have 10 units of A in the ladle. You transferred it to container B. Now Container A has 90 units of A. Container B has 100 units of B and 10 units of A. When you take a scoop from container B, you have about 0.91 units of A, and 9.09 units of B (since that solution is 10/110 liquid A). You add this to container A. Now container A has 90.91 units of liquid A, and 9.09 units of B. However, container B still has the same proportion of liquid A and B after the first mixing - namely, 10/110 liquid A, and 100/110 liquid B. This translates to 9.09 units of liquid A, and 90.9 units of liquid B."
What does repertoire area mean within classical music?,"Your repertoire is the body of works that you have learnt and are able to perform. You may have one or many pieces in your repertoire.  In this context, it sounds like you are being asked for pieces of contrasting style, or from different periods in the history of classical music. If you fulfill the latter, then you pretty much automatically fulfill the first - for instance you could have four sonatas from the Classical period, and you would have to strive hard to make sure they all offered contrasting elements. Or you could choose four different sorts of pieces from the Classical period and show the variety that was present in just one period. Or (and this seems like the safest bet), you could choose four pieces from different periods and they would almost certainly provide plenty of contrast. I'm thinking in terms of Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic, 20th Century, and Contemporary/Modern periods. There is no end to the variety of different styles and types of work since the 20th Century."
Why won't Mitt Romney release his tax returns?,Probably because he ships his income overseas to swiss banks to avoid income tax here.
"When a small child cries, they often start with the initial cry followed by a long-ish pause, and then they start crying again. Why the long pause?",They need to take a breath for their next cry. Longer pauses adds more intensity when the second cry hits.
"How do brands manufacturing non-concentrated, natural fruit juice keep the taste constant?","I'm not so sure they do. I drink apple juice, grape juice, and orange juice and I notice they do change in taste year in and year out and also season in and season out as the source of the fruit changes as seasons change in different parts of the world. So answer is, they don't control it. Some batches are better than others."
"When people talk to animals or babies, why do they tend to talk in a high pitched cutsie manner, and never talk like they would normally?","The heck where are the comments?  The behavior is called mirroring which we humans have accepted as affectionate behavior. When babies babble in their cute high pitch voices, we also babble back.  When cats miaow, we miaow back. Same with kittens"
"Why can you not see deleted comments with a permalink, but you can see deleted threads with one?","Threads tend to be deleted because they break some subreddit rule (no joke posts, post must be a question). Comments tend to get deleted because they break Reddit rules (doxxing, copyright infringement). Of course, either can be removed for the other reason."
Why do big bags of chips have zero trans fats but the smaller version of the exact same chips contains trans fats?,"Because according to FDA regulations, any foods that has 0.5 g of trans fat or less PER SERVING can be labelled as trans fat free. In big bags of chips, the manufacturer can jiggle the serving size so that each serving will have less than 0.5 g. But small bags of chips are generally considered to contain only 1 serving, and so they can't divide out extra servings to screw with the numbers."
"Why does China, India, ect. have so many more people than the rest of the world?","Fertile river valleys that create a lot of good agricultural land. The same reason that the Nile delta is so much more populous than most of the rest of the area. There are lots of other similar examples around the world.  It's also worth noting that China and India are *big*. In terms of land area, China is actually larger than Canada."
How does electrical grounding work for ships? Why is it so complicated?,"It's not about electrical safety directly. If you use a metal hull as ground, especially in salt water, electrolysis can cause corrosion."
Poincaré recurrence theorem,"You have a box of m & ms. You shake it and take them out one by one. Put them back in and repeat. If you keep doing this, eventually you will pull them out in the same order as the first time."
Why does 2008 still feel like a couple of years ago?,"Probably because with each year that goes by, you have a longer frame of reference to what time feels like? I don't think I phrased that well, but what I mean is that if you are 5, one year is 20% of your entire existence. If you are 50, one year is 2% of your life. So, to get the same feeling of ""long ago"", it takes more years, the older you get. Same concept as why summers seem to fly by compared to when you were a kid."
What makes humans want to kiss one another?,Our lips have an inordinate amount of nerve endings in them. Touching them together will stimulate both partners quite a lot.
How penny bidding sites (like QuiBids or Beezid) make their money?,"As far as I know, QuiBids charges $0.60 a bid. So if they see something for $10, that's 1000 bids, and they've made $610. The person buying it gets a pretty good deal and everyone else who bid is screwed."
Difference between Special and General Relativity,"Special relativity describes flat space; general relativity describes curved space. Note that general relativity is a superset of special. It's not an evolutionary step - GR doesn't replace SR like GR replaced Newton. On a scale where the curvature of space is approximately zero, things behave just like SR says.  Note that all other forces and particles inhabit space, so SR is really a statement about the geometry that applies to all forces and particles. Although it was first discovered in the context of electromagnetism, it's not unique to electromagnetism."
"Why do Western movies picture robots and cyborgs like evil beings, but Japan portraits them as the good guys?","This isn't correct at all. Western depictions of cyborgs/robot are often positive (Chappie, WallE, Short Circuit), and depictions in Japanese media are often negative (Bubblegum Crisis is the only one I can think of now because it's been a while since I watched anime). You are seeing a correlation where one does not exist."
How are people colourblind?,"Inside your eye are 3 different kinds of cells for detecting colors, one can see red, one can see green, and one can see blue. In colorblind individuals, one of those is either missing or not functioning properly, and so the number of combinations of colors you can distinguish is drastically lowered. You can still tell most colors apart because even if you may not see green properly, you'll detect the varying shades of red and blue in that color but you're missing some of the information."
How does Southern and Northern US Border control work?,"What's getting left out is where the border guards ask to see your passport, ask what you're bringing in to the country, and so on."
Why do the front wheels of big trucks have such big convex hubcaps and lugnuts?,"The commonality across all those big trucks having a doubled rear wheel. On a doubled wheel, you need to be able to bolt the two wheels together to be secure them. The rims budge out so they can touch each other. & nbsp; The front wheel can't be doubled because it would interfere with steering. In order to only need one spare tire, the truck using the same wheel across the entire trunk, meaning that the budged rim is used for the front wheels. edit: spelling"
What exactly is a G.E.D. and why do people keep making fun of people who take the test?,"The GED is the ""General Educational Development"" test. It is the test that those who drop out of high school, or who fail out of high school take to show that they have learned the equivalent of a high school education. They are made fun of because they have already proven themselves failures by societal standards just having to take the test. It is not a kind thing, but society is seldom kind."
Why is my original iPad completely useless after only a few years of ownership?,"Because the software it's running is made for newer-gen models.    > Is my new iPad going to do this in a couple years?   Eventually, but not for much longer. The newer-gen models are magnitudes faster and more powerful than the first gen."
how big is the internet?,_URL_0_ Check this out. Pretty much answers your questions.
Is there any way the U.N. can hit back at Russia diplomatically?,"Nope, Russia could just veto it since they are on the security council. It's a fundamentally broken system."
How are wells built?,"Wells are not technically built, they are drilled.  In reference to a water well, a company will do some research to see if they can drill a well in the desired area. This all depends on location, ground type, and various other things. If a well is drillable they will bring out a truck, that is basically a small oil derrick, and begin drilling the well. Depending on you location and ground type the depth of the well will vary.  Some places have underground ""rivers"" and can be relatively shallow wells, on the other had, some need to be deeper so that more water will seep into the vacant area that is created by the drilling.  Once the well is drilled you can begin getting water from it using a bucket or a pump.  This is all i know. I hope this answers your question. Resource: had a well drilled on old property. Please correct me if I'm wrong."
What makes raindrops large sometimes but small other times? And is the size of raindrops indicative of how much longer the rain will fall?,"Raindrops form when water vapour in the atmosphere clusters around microscopic solid particles (such as dust) in a process called nucleation. Nucleation is reversible. As water molecules attach themselves to cluster, other molecules are leaving. There is a point called the *critical nuclear size*, at which point the cluster of water molecules is stable. This is the point at which a raindrop forms. The critical nuclear size /critical radius is controlled by temperature. The mathematics tells us that as the temperature is lowered, the critical radius decreases. Hopefully this answers your first question, and if I'm wrong I'd very much like to be called out on it! Cunningham's Law and all that ;) Ultimately, though, the answer lies in thermodynamics."
"How are space agencies sure they are not contaminating Mars/TheMoon, and why do they care?","Well, they use very rigorous clean room techniques to minimize the amount of biological contamination that is on our probes. Beyond that, the harshness of the environment is likely to whittle down at least some of what small amount they miss. But they are not sure they are not contaminating the objects, they probably miss *some* stuff. Not that either environment is especially conducive to life as we know it. The Moon especially, although some things may be able to eek out at least survival on Mars, if not prosperity. They care because we don't want to substantially alter the environment we are studying before we study it, and just in case there could *be* anything alive there, it'd be a shame to accidentally destroy it with competition. Additionally, if we go to all the work to find life and then bring samples back to Earth, it'd be a real bummer if by the time they got here it as just good ole tardigrades or something of the sort."
"Why aren't we concerned with bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms developing resistance to alcohol, chlorine, and other substances used to sterilize medical equipment (and hands)?","It is a good question. The answer is how it works on the organism. Anti-biotics work by interfering with some important function of a bacteria cell. Think of throwing a wrench into a machine and watching it gum up the works. Cells that have different machine arrangements can be more resistant to wrenches. They'll have casings around important stuff or gears that can allow a wrench to slip through the teeth without stopping. Maybe they have extra redundant machines.  Alcohol, chlorine and copper work by physically dismantling the machine. No amount of changing the machine will help when you shown up with a screw driver and start removing things."
"How did the commonality of ""seeing the light"" originate when people are ""crossing over"" or passing away?","When your brain is deprived of oxygen (which is generally happening whenever the thing that's killing you is, you know, killing you), your brain shuts down different parts of itself in a given order, in an attempt to keep you alive as long as possible.  Turns out, when the visual centers of the brain begin losing oxygen, you start getting tunnel vision, plus you lose the ability to see color, which means whatever light source you look at starts looking like the ""light as the end of the tunnel"", even if you happen to be staring at a streetlight or something."
Why does my stationary leg hurt when I ride a skateboard?,"More to the point, it is almost like doing a one legged squat. In addition to holding all your weight up, you are lowering yourself several inches (with one leg) each time you kick/push with the other leg.  I have a adult sized kick scooter where I experience the same thing. I could kick all day, but switch legs often because of the fatigue in the leg on the board."
"Why does electricity ""want"" to be grounded. If there was a bigger planet then Earth here would electricity jump to it instead ?","The more general rule is that a system will tend to minimize its potential energy. For example, a ball on the top of a hill ""wants"" to roll down to minimize its gravitational potential energy. Similarly, a circuit ""wants"" to minimize its electrical potential energy, or voltage (technically voltage is electric potential energy per charge aka electric potential). *Ground* is defined as voltage=0, so a circuit being grounded is like the ball reaching the bottom of the hill."
Who REALLY foots the bill when a corporation goes bankrupt? The unpaid bills?,"Whoever those bills are owed to, as the corporation does not have to pay them, so the debtors are shit outta luck on recouping that money."
Why are textbooks so expensive?,"Because only a small number are printed. If you print a million of something, the costs are divided across that large number and it can be cheaper. Print only 10,000 and the ""fixed"" costs are now divided across 1/100 the number of books."
Why do we have to pay for internet? And why is there a limit?,"You're not paying for ""the internet"". You're paying for a company to *connect* you to the internet. They build the infrastructure, they run a lot of very high-end, very specialised equipment, and they spent a *lot* of money on it. They're not going to let you use those for free."
What and how can start a natural bushfire?,Lighting mainly. When a volcano is conveniently located that will suffice. Plus if you have a decent damp pile of plant matter as it decays it can just get hot enough to burn.
"Why must we let a steak ""rest"" for best flavor, but that just makes it cold?","You just need to let it rest for 5-10 minutes before cutting into it. When you cut it right away after removing from heat, you will notice the plate will fill with liquid. That liquid is full of flavor that the steak loses."
How do food companies determine the expiration date for a product?,"It is calculated by measuring the rates of breakdown under less than ideal storage conditions. With ice cream, the limiting factor is likely to be the time it takes for ice crystals to grow, as well as the oxidation of some fats, degrading the taste and texture of the product. Because of this, it is likely to be called a 'Best Before' than an 'Expiry' date. All of this is very complex, but is reduced to a certain number of days, from which is subtracted a safety margin, again carefully calculated. This is added to the date of production to give an expiry date.  If it has been in your properly functioning freezer, and is a few days over, then chow down and enjoy."
"Why can you hear the voices in the apartment above you so easily, but not the voices in the apartment below you?","Because sound travels through the solid medium ( the floor slab). On the floor above, people are directly in contact with the surface; while on the floor below, you're only depending on the noise traveling through air and noise traveling in air is divided into reflected, absorbed and transferred, major percentage of which, is reflected."
"If you were confined in a small space with limited oxygen that you were trying to conserve, would it be more efficient to take continuous short breaths, or fewer breaths while holding your breath for longer periods of time?",You would want to lower your metabolic rate. Decrease heart rate. Calm down. Take long deep breaths. Make each breath last as long as possible....... I think.
"How comes different phone chargers take widely different time to charge the same phone,despite all being rated 5V 1A?","Chargers also need to tell the phone - in some way - how much power is available. The 1A wall charger provided with your device has the circuitry there to properly communicate with device. The third-party car charger doesn't, so the device might assume it is an overloaded version 1 USB port, and draw the minimum 1/10th of an amp. An interesting point is the Samsung chargers. Although they will provide 1 amp at 5 volts to anything that plugs into them, plug a Samsung device in and it will negotiate up to 20 volts to charge the device quickly."
Why is mace (pepper spray) illegal in the UK?,"There is no such concept as ""defensive weapon"" in any of the UK legal systems. Anything carried with the sole or primary intent of causing injury upon another is always considered an offensive weapon in the UK. Note that the perceived intent of usage is important. If you were carrying a baseball bat outside a town park at 11 o'clock on a Sunday morning you'd be highly unlikely to be stopped by the police. If you had the same bat outside the same park at 2am the police would almost certainly consider it an offensive weapon. Also note that defending yourself in a threatening situation is perfectly legal in the UK, as long as you use ""proportional force"" and that you haven't pre-armed yourself with a weapon."
What is the force that causes you to think of someone moments before they call or text you?,Confirmation bias: You don't notice all the times you didn't think of someone before they called you but the coincidence times you do stick in your mind more.
What are the differences between the North and the South Pole?,"The North Pole is in the middle of the water, usually covered by ice (less so nowadays because of climate change), and has polar bears, but no penguins. The South Pole is on land (Antarctica) and has penguins, but no polar bears.  Also, the North Pole is in the Northern Hemisphere and the South Pole is in the Southern Hemisphere."
How a recession causes lower gas prices.,"Gas prices are largely driven by gas demand. The *demand* for gas however isn't usually driven by prices. That is, most people don't travel less just because gas costs more, they have a set number of miles they *have to* travel to live their lives. Well, if a bunch of people don't have jobs, and don't have any reason to shop, and can't afford to travel, suddenly they use less gas. Gas has to become cheaper to sell all the gas they can make that isn't being used."
Why trees produce different shapes/sizes of leaves.,"A thing to remember about evolution (that I often see is either forgotten or never realized) is that so long as a trait works well enough, and doesn't kill an organism or weaken it to the point of applying direct evolutionary pressure, it will remain. Leaves are a balance between energy expenditure (to grow) and energy production. Trial and error from mutation and different plant branches of the evolutionary tree will lead to variety."
How does my cat know to look at my eyes/face when communicating something?,"It's been a common thing for workers in parts of the world to have to wear face masks on the back of their head because tigers won't attack if they think a person is looking at them. So this goes past domestication and is a hunter instinct. _URL_0_ And just as a tip for owning cats, look them int he eyes every now and then and deliberately blink. It's a sign of trust, as cats stare unblinkingly at people they don't trust."
OJ and the recently discovered knife can we still prosecute him or no since double jeopardy?,"Without considering the Double Jeopardy, the knife was supposedly found years ago and kept by as a souvenir by a cop. It was only recently brought forward as evidence. Pure speculation, but it could be real hard to use it as evidence in court since it was handled improperly.  Edit: improperly"
Why do the body-cells age?,"A few reasons. The most straightforward is that every time a cell copies it's DNA, it uses up a piece of the tail at the end of the DNA called the *telomere*.  When a cell is out of telomere, fragments of the DNA itself start getting used and the cell goes into *telomere panic*. Each copy does damage to the DNA after that."
"Why does the water spray from the shower feel cold when you're standing next to the beam itself, even if the water is warm?",I believe you are feeling tiny borderline microscopic droplets of water which due to their size lose their heat to the environment extremely quickly
why do empty folders contain 0 bytes of data? Don't folder names contain (even a few) bytes of data?,The contents of the folders are 0 bytes of data (no contents). It's like saying a real-life box contains 0 pounds. But the box itself isn't 0 pounds.
"Do caterpillars know they they are going to become butterflies? Or do they just get in a cocoon thinking, what the fuck am I doing?","You're giving them too much credit. When you get to insects that small, and insects in general, scientist aren't even sure they're capable of abstract thought like that, they're closer to biological machine, who just do what they do on instinct alone, their brains aren't really complicated enough to make it seem credible that they can think like we can. Also, whoever commented bfore me, I'm pretty sure you've been shadow banned."
Why do a majority of films that have action scenes usually have the action extremely loud and have all the talking quiet?,"Action scenes (explosions, revving engines, guns) are, in fact, a lot louder than speech. We're just used to most TV programs applying a generous level of dynamic compression so that speech is about the same volume as an explosion. So when a movie does it right it seems too loud."
"Why does food (meat, cheese, bread, vegetables) taste different when sliced thin vs thick?","I would guess it's because there's a greater surface area to volume ratio, so comparatively more of the food gets exposed to the air. The surface of the food will interact with oxygen in the air, affecting the flavor of whatever you are eating."
"Who pays for anti-smoking ads, and why do they want us to quit?","Fun fact: the Truth anti-smoking ads are actually funded (unwillingly) by the big tobacco comapnies. In the late 90's 47 states sued the tobacco industry for the medical financial burden their products put on the state's healthcare systems. Part of the settlement was that the tobacco companies had to fund the [American Legacy Foundation](_URL_0_), a not-for-profit organization dedicated to the eradication of smoking. The ALF is responsible for the Truth advertising campaign."
Why is the camera on the Mars rover so low quality?,"We can, just not yet. These cameras are the initial landing cameras to make sure it survived the landing. Later this week, the fancy dancey cameras will spring up and give us lovely, awesome (like, literally awe-inspiring) imagery. Although it's pretty awesome already in my opinion :)"
Expiration dates for painkillers (details inside),You are looking at date Filled vs date expired. Not date manufactured vs date expired. These drugs are created in large quantities but that doesnt mean they all get distributed at the same time. So the ones you got in 2013 and the ones you got in 2015 could have all been made in 2013. Drugs do expire.
"why are there only ever 2 or 3 NFL games available on tv each Sunday, instead of 5-10 like for college games?","> many games available on standard cable packages like college? Because they make more money the way it is currently setup. It's pretty simple at that. They have limited games on broadcast TV which they charge crazy rates for, which in turn is a limited amount of games people can watch which means everyone is watching them and the networks can charge crazy rates for ads. The NFL then sells exclusive access to Sunday Ticket to DirecTV for a giant rate (DirecTV paid way too much) to make even more money. The NFL is unarguably the best league in the world of sports at crafting and learning how to extract maximum value from their TV rights. Other leagues like the English Premier League, UEFA, NBA and such are all learning from the NFL's examples on how to craft TV deals, the NFL is just the best at it."
"How come old people sound ""old"". I'm not sure how else to explain it but they just sound different and harder to understand?",The cartilages in the vocal tract calcify and stiffen and the muscles get weaker. It makes their voice breathier and makes it more difficult to keep the pitch and loudness steady.
Why do Humans (and most mammals) have individual teeth instead of a beak or solid bony structure?,"Only reason I can think of is, if one of em breaks, we can still chew"
Why do people look away from the point of focus to think?,If you look away there's no stimuli trying to get your attention. You can look at a blank wall and not have anything stimulating you while you search your head for the answer.
"I've heard that no matter where you are in the universe, you're still equidistant from the universe's ""edges"" as it expands. How is this so? Or am I getting this wrong?","The ""edges"" of the universe are just as far as we can see, not physical edges, because the light at the edges is from the beginning of the universe and there can't be any light from before the universe. It's like two ships on the ocean, which both see the horizon equidistant from themselves no matter where they are."
Why are there ashtrays on planes?,"The average lifespan of a commercial jet is 30 years. Smoking was banned on planes in the US in 1988, 24 years ago."
"How come humans generally get into cold water slowly and uncomfortably, but animals jump in with no hesitation?","If you think animals are not afraid of water you have never tried to bath a horse or take one through a puddle. lol.  Humans know there is a choice, that water can be warm or cold.. or even too hot. Animals know the temperature of the lakes/streams as being what they are.. they don't see any reason to be silly and enter it slowly if they need to cross, but sometimes you will see them entering water slowly when they are not in a hurry. Maybe you need to be around nature more."
"What's the difference between tornadoes, hurricanes, cyclones, typhoons etc?","All are spinning masses of air. Tornadoes are much smaller than the others being only a matter of yards across. A cyclone is air spinning around a low pressure system and can be used regardless of the size. Cyclone is also used for a violent tropical storm, especially one originating in the southwestern Pacific Ocean or Indian Ocean. Hurricanes and typhoons are the same thing. If it's in the Atlantic it's called a hurricane and if it's in the Pacific around south East Asia china and Japan it's called a typhoon.   Hurricane can also be used for any wind with a speed over 73mph."
"Why are pregnant women restricted from roller coasters, hot tubs, flights, etc?",Something tells me that subjecting a fragile developing fetus to large gravitational forces isn't a great idea.  Nor is the general large increase in blood pressure.
EILI5: The whole Viva Revolution with Che Guevara?,Che Guevara was one of the leaders of the Cuban Revolution of the 1950s with Fidel Castro. He now enjoys immense popularity as a t-shirt.
"Why do they bother to try and ""hide"" cell phone towers?",Because it simply looks more aesthetically pleasing. Cell phone towers are an eyesore
Full Faith and Credit in the US,"US states can't deny the validity of legal documents in other states. So if I own some property in Texas, and I bring that up as evidence in an Oklahoma court case, the court can't decide it doesn't count because it's from the wrong state."
How much of the music does a songwriter actually write?,"It is sort of complicated. Generally, the person credited as the ""writer"" comes up with the main composition, or chord structure and melody for the song.  For instance- Sting is listed as the sole composer for ""Every Breath You Take"", because he came up with the chord structure- but when you think about that song, it is Andy Summers' guitar riff that probably comes to mind. However- Sting pulls in a reported $2k per day in royalties, while Summers gets squat. The thought being that the other musicians (bass, drums, horns, etc) are merely playing along to the already ""composed"" structure of the song. Yes- they are still ""writing"" their parts- but the structure already existed."
Dress sizes? What do they mean?,Men's sizes are based on measurements. [Women's sizes are based on lies.](_URL_0_)
Why do we use implants for breast enlargement instead of something biological like stomache fat?,Fat is a living tissue. Transplants of living tissue are more expensive and have higher risk of complications. Implants are biologically inert and relatively easy to implant.
Why does the svartifoss waterfall cliff have squares,"It looks like [basalt pillars](_URL_0_) erroded from the bottom. Basalt, due to the crystalline structure or something like that, naturally forms these shapes."
How to catch up/develop a well informed opinion on world news and politics?,"Personally, I like Christian Science Monitor (even though I'm an atheist. They do good reporting) and The Economist. The BBC is also good for factual stories on world events."
Tomatoes and peppers are native to the Americas. Why are they identified with traditional Italian/Indian/Chinese/etc food?,"A handful of centuries is an extremely long time. I wouldn't be surprised if the foods you mention almost completely supplanted traditional foods in Asia and Europe. Many New World crops offered vastly superior yields and nutritional value -- the introduction of potatoes to northern Europe caused an increase in available food which was followed by an increase in population which in turn necessitated the growing of more and more potatoes to feed the area's population. If I recall correctly the yam or possibly the sweet potato had the same effect in China. Regarding your original question, though; try Google or Wikipedia."
Why are nike shoes $150 or more and how do they enhance performance in sports?,"It's a fashion statement mostly. Don't get me wrong - there's some technology and research there, but not nearly enough to really affect, well, anything that much. You may jump a few millimeters higher through some new bouncy sole and lighter material. And there is some stability enhancements that will slightly reduce the risk of a rolled ankle. And some fabric may allow the foot to ""breathe"" a hair better. But in the end, it's clever marketing."
How all these big websites lately have been getting their data hacked.,"Properly securing websites is one of those things where if you're doing your job right, no one notices. If you're doing it wrong, no one notices until you get compromised. This is why it often doesn't get enough attention. In addition, because various sites are architected in many different ways in terms of software and topology, there's no one ""right way"" to secure things. Whereas there exist best practices for Wordpress blogs for example, time must be spent to determine where more complex systems are vulnerable. That doesn't excuse basic mistakes like not salting passwords or leaving database ports open, however. Some of the recent attacks are not technological, but rather are social engineering. If users are giving away their credentials, there's no foolproof solution."
"The ""Economic gap"" between the ""1%"" and the ""99%""","This is obviously a very complicated question, ~~Nobel Prize winning~~ economist Thomas Piketty set out to explore it in his book Capital. What it comes down to is this: If you make enough money (and only enough) to keep you alive, you will never get any richer. Every day you will earn $5 and at the end of the day you will have $0 left, and so the cycle repeats until you die. But if you earn $6, you can put away some of that money. You can save $1 a day and put it in a bank account. You can set the money to work, *to make you more money*. For the super-rich, this is even more extreme. The more money you make, the more you can invest, and the more you make off of those investments that you can then re-invest. It's a positive feedback loop."
What would happen if you were quiet for years?,"The vocal folds (also known as your vocal cords) are mucous membranes. Unlike muscles, which can atrophy and deteriorate from lack of use, using or not using the vocal cords doesn't really make a huge difference in their well-being. You might have some voice breaking or stammering when you try to speak again after a long time, but it's not like they would waste away from lack of use.  I believe that the biggest impact from lack of speaking would be more psychological. If you're in a situation where you can manage to not speak for any reason, you probably will not have a lot of human contact, which can affect your mental health in various different ways."
Can imaginary numbers be represented visually?,"One very helpful concept that helped me understand complex numbers is [this](_URL_0_). It makes a lot more sense when you think about it in the way described above. Real numbers lie on a real number line, going forward for positive numbers and going backward for negative numbers.  But imaginary numbers force you to deviate off the real number line by rotating about the origin and going off in that direction."
The difference between race versus ethnicity.,"Simplistically and quite generally, race is what most people think of as one's physical form, and is based on outward appearance. Ethnicity is what most people think of as one's background, and is based on things like language, clothing, religious customs, etc. There are no hard lines between these designations, some overlap, and their definition is also very fluid, depending on the preconceptions and background of the observer themselves.  Generally, when thinking of race, an observer will describe someone as being Black, or Asian, or White. This same observer might describe that persons ethnicity as being Jamaican, Vietnamese, or Polish.  There are all sorts of problems with these kinds of artificial designations, the most important of which is that there really is no such thing as [""race](_URL_0_)"" *per sé*."
Why do we get so much satisfaction out of popping things?,"It's actually pretty simple. When we get surprised or something happens suddenly, our brains send blood and endorphins through our body. Popping something provides us with a ""controlled"" surprise where we know we are going to be surprised and we also know that we wont be harmed. So we get the benefits of being surprised without the risk."
"Why is the measurement of time (seconds, minutes, hours) based around the number 60? Why not a more common base, like 10 or 100?","60 is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, and 30. Lots of options for splitting time into neat segments. You can divide 60 into halves, thirds, quarters, fifths, sixths, tenths, twelfths, fifteenths, twentieths, and thirtieths. 10 is only divisible by 2 and 5. So you can only divide it neatly into halves and fifths. It's just not as flexible. Edit: I'm a political junkie, so I comment on a lot of threads featuring hot-button issues. But according to my inbox, this is the most incendiary comment I've ever made."
"Why do we, and all other animals, breath and use oxygen when nitrogen is so much more available in the atmosphere?","The nitrogen gas molecule (N2) is extremely stable and hard to crack apart. Most living organisms can't do it - most of the biological nitrogen in existence came from specialized bacteria. On the other hand, the oxygen gas molecule (O2) is highly reactive, meaning its energy can be harnessed for useful chemical reactions, like those that support life."
How are police sketch artists able to draw people relatively accurately based on descriptions?,"It's something of an open question whether they are all that accurate. Often they are accurate only in the gross details (hair colour, large nose, etc) and aren't otherwise recognisable.  It's quite rare for a suspect to be identified purely on the basis of an accurate sketch, though."
Why do most song lengths seem to fall between 2 and 4 minutes?,"Much of the answer has to do with the length limitations of vinyl 7"" 45 rpm singles, which for many years were the primary means of promoting a single song. You can only fit about 3 minutes of music onto a 45 rpm single. So historically, if you wanted to write a hit pop song, you had to keep it under that length. More here: [Why Are Songs On The Radio About The Same Length?](_URL_0_)"
What is that falling feeling you get in your stomach when you go down a hill in a car or rollercoaster,"Did you ever jump into a cool swimming pool or river or something, and notice after five minutes or so that it's no longer cold? That's because your body 'gets used' to things after a bit.  Your body is used to gravity (and in fact evolved to take advantage of gravity). So you don't even notice that your insides... and the content of your insides, are all under one gee of gravity, because it's always been that way.  But get on that roller coaster (or even a really fast elevator) and you're exposed to sometimes-more, sometimes-less gees of gravity that make your innards heavier or lighter, as well as anything in them.  So you have upward pressure in your belly region and throat and their content when you round the crest of a big hill at speed, and downward pressure when you hit that curve at the bottom. And the best your brain can translate that to is a falling feeling."
Why is the sea made out of salt water?,Almost all natural water contains salts and other minerals including rivers and sweet water lakes just in different levels. Rivers flow constantly so the salt they pick up from the ground does not have time to build up to the point where it tastes salty. But oceans and lakes get all of this salt poured into them by the rivers where it builds up until even we can taste it. Some more info: _URL_0_
"What do investment bankers actually do? Goldman Sachs, etc.","treedick is speaking about regular banks that give loans..not investment bank. Let's take Goldman Sachs' Investment Banking division Basically, they underwrite securities. Facebook is going public, they go to an investment bank to help them raise capital. Investment banks are financial intermediaries."
Why is it okay to say racist things about white people and sexist things about men but not the other way around?,"If you want the actual explanation for why some people say this, it is the following: People *claim* that it isn't actually racism because racism = prejudice + power. So if you are a historically disadvantaged group (therefore less power), nothing you do can be racist. It can be bigoted, intolerant, or ignorant - but not *racist*.  Does it make much sense? No, I don't think so. If you want equality, practice equality. Pretty simple. But that is how people try to justify it, anyway. You also have a non-trivial amount of people who just hear ""blacks can't be racist"" (or whatever group you want to use) and go around using that to justify obviously racist/sexist actions without understanding the ""justification"" at all."
What is bad about universities like the University of Phoenix and DeVry?,"They admit anyone who has (or can borrow) the money to pay them, regardless of whether they are ready or able to do the coursework.  They provide subpar education at excessive cost.  Their graduates tend to find themselves not particularly employable, and in a lot of debt."
How do wireless speakers work?,"Just like radio. There is a transmitter and a reciever. In the case of Bluetooth, the transmitter is something like a smartphone. Then the speaker recieves the signal, and amplifies it."
how do people deep fry ice cream? Wouldn't it melt?,"First of all the ice cream for this is frozen at extremely cold temps, then it is quickly battered and fried, so while the ice cream softens up a little....it is still plenty cold."
Why does my nose get runny when I eat/drink something hot.,"Spicy foods irritate the mucus membranes in your head and lungs. Your body reacts to this by making you create mucus, to coat and protect you from whatever may be causing the irritation. You also tear to protect your eyes, which drains into your nose, exacerbating your snot nose.  You can also sweat because your body thinks it's overheating, and is trying to cool itself down.  I always put some hot sauce on my food and over time you gain a sort of resistance. Can be a fun way to win bets."
Someone dies before they get a chance to retire. What happens to all of their social security benefits?,"Immediate family of the deceased are eligible to receive the deceased benefits under certain situations, in part or full.  Kids get less than spouses. When an unmarried, no kids, divorced, or already widowed person died, the payment liability disappears.  The gov doesn't have to pay anyone."
Is Magneto (from X-Men) good or bad?,"Think of Magneto (and Charles Xavier) as ideologies.  X-Men has always been a metaphor for people who are different, marginalized, etc. Thinking back to the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's (when X-Men was created), you had people advocating non-violent protest (Martin Luther King Jr.) and you had people who were, well, not necessarily violent, but definitely more militant (Malcolm X). Both had more or less the same goals, but their methods and messages were different. Charles Xavier is MLK, Magneto is Malcolm X. They did have to write things in to make Magneto be more towards the ""bad"" sides when talking about mutant superiority (which is subjective), which isn't related at all to civil rights, but the Professor and Magneto started at the same point and diverged."
"Why does Bayern Munchen/Munich have the 2 names, and which one is ""correct""?",Bayern is English for Beieren. Beieren is a province located in the south of Germany. Munich is English for München. München is a city located in the province of Beieren.
The controversy surrounding the 2000 election (George W. Bush vs Al Gore),"It was an extremely close race, the deciding state being Florida. 537 more Floridians voted for Bush than for Gore, but across the board, in the entire country, Gore got more of the popular vote. So the supreme court made the decision that since Bush won Florida, the deciding state, by a margin of 537 votes, that Bush had won the presidency. Somebody Correct me if I'm wrong please."
What's the difference between a flash drive and external hard drive?,"An external hard disk is called as such because it utilizes a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). One of these drives has a metal platter with different magnetic sections, called sectors, that are read by a small magnetic sensor called a head on the end of an actuator arm. Many people are now moving over to flash storage, however, which is what a flash drive utilizes and thus is named for. Flash storage does not contain moving parts but rather is similar to a large grid of capacitors and transistors that are used to keep data. It is faster to access than an HDD because you do not need to wait for the disk to spin to the correct location. It can decay, however, unlike an HDD. The more an area of flash is written the more it wears out and eventually it will fail."
Why are colleges and universities so different from each other (Yale vs a local community college) but all of the information taught in school is the same for their respected fields ?,"I studied physics at a reasonably high-ranked school, and I can tell you definitively that 90% of what I learned that actually stuck was from working with other students, not from lectures. The caliber of fellow students is hugely important in my opinion, and you simply get better students at better schools. I also contest your statement that the information taught is the same. With better professors and better students, more can be covered in the same amount of time, so subjects can be taught more completely and more thoroughly."
"How do various worms dig into people, and how do we not feel it?",they normally enter through food when they are very very small.  alternately there are some parasites who can enter through cuts that already exist in the skin.
why are transgender issues suddenly all over the place?,"Causes are fashion for many people. And transgender issues are currently the most fashionable. I say this as someone who fully believes that trans people deserve equality and freedom from persecution, but also as someone who recognises that people clearly bandwagon."
How can clams grow shells?,"In a very similar manner to how humans grow bones and teeth. They capture the elements they need to form them from their environment, and react them together in such a way as to deposit a solid mineral in the places they need it."
Black athletes with hyphenated names,No I meant why is it so prevalent in black athletes. I know about hyphenated names with divorced parents.  I want to know why it seems to only occur in black athletes and not in other races IN SPORTS.
"I had a fruit fly wander into my microwave and I decided to nuke him for 3 minutes, for science of course, and in the end the little bugger flew out. How is this possible?","1. The insect is too small to act as an efficient receiver of microwave energy. 2. There area areas within the machine that get far less energy, and (by moving from hot to not-hot areas) the fly can seek them out."
"what is ""old man"" strength?","Nobody's mentioned this, so I figured I'd give my $0.02. Old man strength is typically from those who have been performing some form of physical labor for a long time, and have such developed incredible grip strength. This is the part that /u/WOT_IF_UR_LEGS is talking about where it feels as if they can crush your hands. Additionally, what they may lack in raw power, they make up for from years of lifting heavy objects and have developed a proficiency in it so that they may look a lot weaker (old man) than they really are (strength)."
Why Do People Have Fetishes?,"There's not really a 100% established answer for why, or what causes people to have fetishes. The more common explanations are a result of conditioning and psychological development.  Conditioning is where a non-typical object, body part, or act is associated with sex by pairing it with typical erotic stimulation, either visual, audio, or physical. So for example someone could develop a sexual fetish for women in boots by watching porn where women are wearing boots, or just by touching themselves in an arousing way while looking at the boots themselves. Psychological Development suggests that the roots for sexual fetishes often develop during childhood. It can arise from things such as social taboos, if it's forbidden or frowned upon to show a specific body part (such as calves) then maybe seeing a naked calf when you hit puberty could be considered arousing."
I've been without an internet connection since June 12th. What's going on in the world?,Most major stuff has already been covered but: *The largest Ebola outbreak ever is going on right now
Why is a mouse more accurate than a joystick on a controller,"Because with a computer mouse you move it exactly X distance on the table so the cursor moves Y distance. With a joystick, you essentially 'toggle' the cursors movement in any given direction, for a certain length of time, until the cursor reaches what you need. It's also less accurate because you're dealing with a fixed joystick instead of a mouse that you can move all the way across your desk if you wanted to. This is my interpretation of it, anyway"
When was the last time in human history it would be more common to see someone walking barefoot than with shoes or sandals?,It was common up until the 1950s in the south for children to go without shoes. It is still somewhat common in regions with lots of creeks.
Why do some drinks seem to pass right through you whereas plain water is retained?,"The sugar and electrolytes in Gatorade and other sports drinks actually increase how much water you absorb into your blood stream. This can be perceived as too much fluid and your body will try to get rid of it if you aren't actually dehydrated. Normal water, on the other hand, lacks the sugar and electrolytes that promote water absorption so it stays around in your gut longer."
How does a disease make a comeback like Ebola or the Bubonic plague have recently?,"Ebola has no cure, or even a real treatment. It never really went away. It's just that humans aren't commonly exposed to it (it probably normally lives in bats), and when they are it tends to kill quickly enough that it burns itself out. So you see a series of fairly quick and nasty outbreaks in the areas in which infected bat populations come in contact with humans, in west and central Africa.  Plague is different, in that it's curable with antibiotics. It lives in various rodents, and occasionally breaks out because it too has never really gone away. If it happens in a richer country, it's usually dealt with pretty easily. Isolated cases pop up in the US and Canada now and again, incidentally."
How do they clean up the lead at gun ranges?,Nowadays that lead is worth good money as scrap. There are guys that come out with some attachment that fits on a tractor that kind of sifts the lead out of the dirt. The gun range makes big money for letting them come take the lead.
why are some people are more prone to insect bites?,"I don't know about other bugs but mosquitoes have a preference for type O blood. CO2 also attracts them, and pregnant women exhale more CO2. Also alcohol (as little as 12 ounces of beer) seems to increase their attraction to you; possibly because it raises your body temperature."
Why are timeshares considered a scam?,"You basically ""Own"" a part of a property and you only get to use it a few weeks a year, yet you pay property taxes, upkeep costs and ""Association Dues"" year round. Most people don't want to spend all their vacations at the same place every year, but if you have a time-share, you're wasting money if you don't use it."

How does an electron microscope work and can it be used on living tissue?,"An electron microscope works by passing electrons across the object that it's scanning. Basically, the object is coated with a heavy metal, and the electrons that bounce off get recorded, and it gets put into a computerized image that gets manually colored for effect. Electron microscopes require the object to be placed in a vaccuum, so no, it cannot be used on living objects. Source: Bio student"
What's so bad about Detroit?,"Poverty Jobs left the city at an ever accelerating pace over the past few years and this has led to lower and lower incomes and, consequently, higher crime and lower property values.  As it gets worse fewer companies would think of moving in and bringing back jobs and the situation worsens and worsens. Their economy was heavily reliant on manufacturing and that is the way of the past for this country as factories move to the employer friendly south."
Why can't multi-billion dollar companies have less profit and pay their employees more without wrecking the economy.,they could.  but what would be the benefit to the owners of the company by having less profit? what would be the benefit to shareholders who are looking for the company to maximize profits?
Why do animals eyes light up in certain colours when shone at with a torch/light?,Many especialy night active animals have a layer of reflective tissue behind the light sensing cells at the back of the eye. That allows them to caputer more light in their light sensing cells. Additionaly that makes the eyes act as a retroreflector (meaning they will reflect light back paralell to the incomming light) like in the bottom image here: _URL_0_ . The color comes from the tissue that surrounds the lightsensing cells absorbing some of the light.
"How come we can land probes on comets and send satellites around the galaxy, but we can't put a high resolution color camera on these devices?","We could now. But this probe was launched 10 years ago, and was designed and built mostly during the 90s."
Why some credit card transactions require a billing address and some only require a zipcode?,"CVV codes are not mandatory, it is up to the person/company as to whether or not they want to require it or not. In some cases their Merchant provider will offer cheaper rates on transaction when CVV is used, as it leads to less fraud however some retailers choose not to do that. Many merchants still refuse to include a security code field in their online checkout forms, because they believe that doing so may confuse some of their customers or otherwise put them off and lead to lost sales. It's also a violation of PCI compliance to store CVV numbers, which helps reduce fraud but since the CVV can't be stored it means that the buyer has to have their card with them at time of purchase (again that is good in terms of anti-fraud), but some companies do believe that can hurt sales."
How do gradients work in tatoos,"Hi there i tattoo and its exactly how they said. The needles dont need to penetrate too deep and the more times you go over it the darker it becomes you want to go from lightest to dark. You cant take dark back. We water down the black in different amounts or whatever colors and just like water color painting we blend in the shading/colors. White is not the proper way to do a greyscale tattoo. White is meant for accenting and highlighting. Multiple needles at different sizes are also key to this process with the right amount of voltage and speed, and plenty of lubrication for the skin to not be damaged."
How did the russian revolution start?,"The Russian Revolution is actually two revolutions, the February revolution and the October revolution (Stalin, btw, was involved in neither). During World War 1, in February 1917, a bunch of workers in Russia started a strike, and basically everybody ended up joining it, including the army and eventually some key figures of the Czar's government. They forced the Czar to step down and give power to the Provisional Government, that was supposed to organize free elections, but ended up being removed from power in November by a group of Bolsheviks, lead by Lenin and Trotsky. The basic reasons were that the Russians were losing WW1, and that there was a lot of poverty and hunger. Also, the Czar was very unpopular because he taxed heavily and was very dictatorial. It turned out that the Provisional Government really didn't do that much better, so that gave Lenin the chance he took to get some support for this second revolution."
How do the water intake on this nuclear plant work? And how this guy managed to go from the inlet to the outlet without a scratch?,"Nuclear engineer here. He was sucked from he ocean to the intake bay. At the far end of the intake bay is where the pumps push water through the plant.  The intake bay water level is at a slightly lower elevation than the ocean, which created the pressure that sucked him through. He didn't pass through any pumps or the plant, just an intake pump to the bay."
How do the mammals of the ocean hydrate themselves.,They have awesome kidneys.  The kidneys are able to filter the water to hydrate the body and remove the salt. Human kidneys are not so awesome.
"""PTSD is a cultural product"" what does that mean?","If I understand this correctly, what its saying is that PTSD only exists as a recognised disorder because of the ability we have to study it. It never used to be recognised. In wars, for example, people would get it and be labelled as cowards, because it wasn't understood what the sufferers were going through. I think its similar to our modern day view of depression. Maybe back in the day, depressed people were seen as someone who just needs to harden up, a bit of a downer all the time. Now, though, we realise its a proper disorder that the patient can't control, as opposed to a voluntary sadness. In the same way, now that we have studying PTSD and its effects, we can recognise it as a disorder, not just someone being anxious and touchy and aggressive."
"Why can most things in the body be transplanted, except the eyes?","Whole eyes are really tricky to transplant for a few reasons: 1. The retina dies in only 2-4 hours without a blood supply. The donor and recipient would have to be right by each other. 2. The retina is part of the brain, so if a donor is brain dead, the eye would be dead too. You have to harvest the eye right after the donor's heart stops. 3. You have to connect the optic nerve, which has 1.3 million individual nerves that need to link up. 4. You need to suppress the immune system so it doesn't recognize the new eye as a foreign and attack it. (Although this isn't as bad as for other organs since the eye is generally protected from the immune system.) Actually this stuff isn't that far off. Researchers have already transplanted eyes in mice who survived for 200 days. But they aren't sure how much vision those mice had restored. Still, even 30% vision restored gives people independence and is better than complete blindness."
"Weird vibrating eye ""trick""","it's called nystagmus. It can appear as a problem for some people, in which it is uncontrolled, but some people are able to do it voluntarily. Other than the obvious vision problems for people who have involuntary nystagmus and can't 'switch it off', I'm not aware of it being a cause of any sort of damage."
Why are highway and street signs usually white text on green (at least in the US)?,"You're correct that white and black would provide the greatest contrast, but the primary issue isn't contrast. Highway signs are ""retroreflective,"" meaning that at night, when you shine your headlights on them, the light not only illuminates the sign, but the sign also directly reflects a good amount of that light back at you. Black backgrounds would not be efficient retroreflectors (since black absorbs most light, reducing reflectivity), plus they would be difficult to see at night since the sky is black. Green was chosen since the eye is highly sensitive to green, it is clearly visible day and night, and it is a good retroreflector. Green is a common choice in many countries, including Canada, Japan, China, and Australia. Many European countries opt for blue backgrounds with white text or white backgrounds with black text."
Japanese vs American automobiles,American cars used to be the hallmark of reliability. I think a variety of reasons contributed to the decline of quality in American cars. From an econ/financial perspective it just became too expensive to build quality cars. Labor costs for automotive companies kept going up because unions kept wanting more benefits and higher pay for less work. The companies can't redistribute the extra costs to the consumers because that will just drive them to their competition even faster so they did the only thing they could and cut down on quality.
Why do vehicles that carry a lot of people not require seatbelts?,"I asked a school-bus driver once about this, and he replied that kids would use the seat belts as weapons. I, for one, could definitely see my teenage self smacking my seatmate with a seatbelt."
"I always hear about spacetime, but what proof do we have that it exists and that all theories based on it are accurate?","There have been [a number of experiments](_URL_0_) that have shown general relativity to be a more accurate theory of gravity than the classic Newtonian model.  For example, our GPS satellites have to correct for relativistic effects. The fact that your GPS works is proof positive that general relativity is a thing."
"Canadians: What's the political situation with Quebec? What's with the whole ""revolution"" thing?","Think of a teenager screaming at parents and siblings saying nobody understands me, I'm moving out. Then stays home sulking when they find out they would have to do their own laundry and cooking, and pay for their own groceries. Then says they are staying, but only if they get their own apartment above the garage. Then finally coming out of their room on pizza night, load up their plate, and sits watching tv with the volume up, ignoring everyone else in the family, refusing to share the remote.  So, yeah, a passive aggressive teenager."
Are product restocking fees BS or is there some legitimacy to them?,"How do you define BS? It costs the business money to have employees around to put the item back into inventory, makes their logistics less efficient, etc.  The entire area of return policies is a strange one. Businesses are under no obligation to accept returns for any reason. Anything they do is strictly for marketing or customer retention reasons. How much did the restocking fee affect your willingness to do business with them down the road? Did it affect your initial purchase decision?"
"Why do you have to get your oil changed after 3 months if you haven't driven 3,000 miles?","And you're told this by people who sell oil. Maybe that should give you a clue. Certainly in modern cars, that should be unnecessary. Edit: Spelling"
Computer Graphics Cards,"Numbering is just a nice way of differentiating the new cards from the old cards. Occasionally it switches. For instances, years ago, NVidia was making cards with thousand series (4XXX up to 9XXX). Then for some reason, they decided not to do 10XXX and started with hundred series (2XX up to currently 6XX). As for specs, there really isn't an ELI5 answer to most of it. In General, for all Cards, a Higher RAM number indicates a better card (Some higher end GFX cards have 2 GB of RAM [Though its usually listed as 2048 MB of RAM]). As for the Other Specs, AMD and NVidia have diverged in how they make their cards, so there aren't a whole lot comparisons you can make anymore just looking at each cards specs. You could go to a PC Repair shop and ask them to install it for you, though it might run you like $50 or more to have that done."
Why is it the iphone (and other smartphones) requires a separate file type for a ringtone instead of being able to use mp3's already on it?,"Because that's how they are set up, ringtones are a separate purchase, so they don't want to lose money buy allowing you to natively create a ringtone from song files on your device.   There are of course super simple ways to manually make them into ringtones. It's just that when you pay for the song, you are paying for a copy to be downloaded and played, not to be used as a ringtone.   I wouldn't mind so much if it was a 49¢ purchase, but the average one is $1.29, the same price as the whole song, while only a handful are 99¢.  TLDR: greed"
"The difference between DVD-R and DVD+R, CD-R and CD+R?","DVD-R and DVD+R are two DVD formats. This means that the way the data is stored on the discs themselves is slightly different. From a user's perspective they both function the same and have almost the same capacity (-R has 7MB more). DVD-R came first and is the ""old"" format. DVD+R is newer and has some advantages. For example its format is more resilient to errors (can handle more scratches). DVD-R can be read by any DVD player, new or old. However DVD+R can only be read by more recent DVD players. CDs come in only one format."
How can peristaltic movements transport liquids?,"Peristalsis works like this: _URL_0_ Stick a drinking straw in a cup full of water, place your thumb over the end of the straw, and lift it out of the water so that the straw is full of water but no longer in cup. Pinch the straw flat with the thumb and forefinger of your other hand up near where your thumb is covering the end and pull down, still squeezing and covering the end with your other thumb.  That's basically how peristalsis works. The muscles pinch the ""tube"" in a small area (be it your esophagus, intestines, etc) and force its contents along with a wave motion. It pinches, pushes a little ways, and releases. The next muscle pinches it again, pushes it a little ways, and releases. This process repeats until the contents get where they're going."
How does the ISS maintain it's altitude without crashing into the planet?,"So you know when your throw a ball it follows a curved path down back to the ground? Well the ISS is moving so fast and is so high up that it's curved path equals the curvature of the earth, so it approaches the earth just as fast the earth curves away from it, so the distance between the earth and the station remain, fairly, constant."
"what's the difference between an ""escort"" and prostitute?","Looks price and class. That's it. When you pay for an escort you're paying for ""the girlfriend experience"" you talk to them eat with them you know go on a ""real"" date but at the end you know your getting lucky. With a whore your getting some drug addicted pimp abused woman who only wants to get you off as fast as she can so she can fuck some other guy in 10 seconds with out cleaning up. That's the difference."
What is stopping us from just replacing our natural adult teeth with synthetic ones?,Mostly Price. Where I live it costs around £1000-£1500 for 1 dental implant.
"Since whales are mammals, and need water to live like we do, how do they get it if they live in salt water, which is bad to drink?","They get it from the food that they eat. Whales, and dolphins, can't starve to death, they die of dehydration first.  They do get a little bit from sea water but their kidneys can't remove much salt so if they accidentally drink too much sea water when they eat that could kill them."
How are outside noises able to be incorporated into your dream?,"Brains are complex things. While dreaming you are thought to be basically consolidating the memories you want to keep and not keep, and you create scenes in your mind involving things that were important to you recently (consciously or unconsciously). So while your brain is doing all of that, your ears, eyes, nose, and mouth are still wired in. Incoming stimuli from any one of those sensory organs can be implemented into the seemingly chaotic mess of neural activity that we call dreaming."
"How does a boat motor work, and how does a small propeller move such a large object?","The small propeller moves a small stream of water, just as wide as the propeller, at a speed that's much faster than the boat moves. This stream of water has more mass than you'd think, because water is quite heavy, and it has a momentum (m • v). All this momentum goes into the boat, because momentum is conserved (the old physics rule ""Every action has an equal and opposite reaction"") so since the boat has a larger mass it gets a smaller increase in velocity. It's surprisingly effective because well designed boats experience very little water friction, that's how you can paddle a canoe that floats your weight, plus the canoe, plus your stuff."
What is being 'calculated' by supercomputers?,"I work at a research university, and system administration of our supercomputers falls under my team's responsibilities. What ours supercomputer do is simulation. They simulate things like chemicals interactions, nuclear reactions, electronic systems, and many other things. In many areas of research, it is a lot cheaper to develop models that can be simulated in supercomputers to test ideas, instead of experimenting with real world systems. Our research groups use their models on our supercomputers to research solar energy, advanced films, water treatment, artificial intelligence, medical imaging, and a lot more. All of this requires a lot of processing power because 1, these are complex models involving the interactions between multiple dimensions of variables; 2, because being able to perform calculations faster means either getting results sooner, or being able to simulate systems in more detail, with better results."
"How does Italy regard it's history in terms of their involvement in WW2 different from their ""ally"" Germany?","Because at one point during the war (1943) the Italian King had Mussolini arrested and at this point Italy was not part of the Axis (Germany, Italy and Japan) anymore. Germany, from an ally became an invading force of Italy. Also, the anti-Jewish laws were repealed by the new Badoglio government while the war was still going on.  Basically, by the end of the war, Italy was not viewed as one of the 'bad guys' anymore. So while for Germany there were the [Nuremberg trials](_URL_0_), where all the atrocities committed by Germany came into surface, no such trial took place against Italy.  So it's a combination of two things: a. Italy probably didn't commit atrocities comparable to Germany; b. any war crimes Italy did commit did not undergo the same level of inquiry of those commited by Germany."
The Operation Teapot video is one of the craziest things I've seen. What exactly am I seeing?,"> but what are the ""eruptions"" coming from it? Was it detonated in the air? It was detonated on the top of a tall tower. The ""eruptions"" are the guy-wires that stabilized the tower being boiled into gas and plasma from the light of the explosion before the blast wave proper reaches them."
How does bioluminescence work?,"In the case of fireflies (I don't know if it is representative for all organisms) it's an enzyme called ""luciferin"" that undergoes a chain of reaction that emits light. It first reacts with ATP, the basic energy provider to almost all processes in our body, turning into ""luciferyl adenylate"". This in turn can react with Oxygen, turning into ""oxyluciferin"". The interesting thing about this reaction is that it produces oxyluciferin in an excited state. That means that one of its electrons has more energy than usual and is moving at a higher speed further away from the molecule than in it's basic, unexcited form. The electron will eventually ""fall down"" from this high energy state, ""dumping"" the energy difference in form of a photon of a certain color corresponding to the energy difference. This is the basic mechanism that produces the light of most light sources besides incadescent."
I read on reddit to get rid of a persons hicups ask them when are they going to pay you back for money they owe you when they really dont owe you. I tried it and it worked why?,"I once had someone cure my hiccups by asking me ""Hey, what color is eggplant? Do you see anything eggplant colored in this room?"" I looked around intently and couldn't find anything, and I told him no. He then asked me if they were gone, and sure enough, totally cured. I think something about the act of suddenly focusing on something else entirely had something to do with it. Maybe someone asking you for money you owe them has a similary effect?"
How can they clone living animals?,"Well, most people use the word ""clone"" to mean something other than it actually is. I blame the popular sci-fi use of cloning to refer to creating an exact duplicate of a person, along with their memories and personality and such. In real life, cloning means to take the DNA of an animal, and create a new baby animal with the same DNA. So it's more like creating a new identical twin baby of the original creature, and not at all like creating an exact copy of that creature."
"the difference between shampoo, conditioner, body soap, 2-in-1 and 3-in-1.","Shampoo is a type of soap designed for your hair. It gets grease out of your hair.  You should only shampoo your head. Don't put shampoo on the ends of your hair if you're a girl, it's too harsh and will damage your hair. Conditioner puts the life back in hair after being shampooed. It moisturizes it. Body soap is a soap designed for your skin. It gets dirt off your skin. You can't just wash dirt and grease off with water because water and oil don't mix. Soap is an ""emulsifier"" it means that it makes it so water can wash away oil. 2-in-1 is conditioner and shampoo mixed together. So you only have to use one product to wash your hair. There's a lot of rumors that it's bad for your hair. From what I've learned, if you have very fine hair then it's better to not use a 2 in 1. But most hair works just fine for a 2 in 1.  3 in 1 is shampoo, conditioner and body soap all mixed in one. Guys usually use this. You can literally put it on any part of your body."
how does your brain decide you like/dislike a certain song? What influences that? And why do we all like different songs?,"Basically, it comes down to sensing versus perceiving. Generally everyone senses the same things the same way, from vision to taste, excluding those with sensory deprivations (colorblindness, deafness, etc.).  Perceiving is a different story. It's all in your head. We attach meaning to different sensations. Like when you see your SO and get happy if you're in a great relationship. Basically you attach meaning to different sounds you hear. People tend to like major keys that are consonant, but of course not all because different people attach different meanings based on their experiences! Hope this helps, this is the first ELI5 explanation that I've done! Feel free to ask further questions!"
How do LED thermometers work?,"Op are you talking about Laser Temperature Guns/thermometers?? (That tell the temp after pointing the device and laser at an object)  If you are: the laser doesn't have anything to do with the temp, it just aligns the sensor that is located right next to the laser on the front of the device."
How is the 3D effect created in movies?,"You need a second camera that is filming from a slightly different perspective, just like humans can see in three dimensions because they have two eyes set slightly apart. (In computer animation you can arbitrarily create a second perspective on a scene, so it's easier but it still requires extra rendering to produce the film.) You play back footage from both perspectives at the same time, but the viewer wears polarized lenses which filter the image so that the left eye sees one thing and the right eye another. You may recall older 3D using colored lenses for the same purpose. You can also process a standard film to give it computer-generated 3D effects. This is a lot cheaper than filming a real 3D movie, but the result tends to be ugly."
Why is sleep so comfortable shortly upon waking(especially when you have work/school/etc)?,"When you wake up in the morning, you get something called sleep inertia. It's the groggyness you feel up to two hours (usually half an hour) after you have woken up.  It's a ""false"" kind of sleepy, which makes you want to stay in bed. This combined with how comfortable your warm, soft bed is, makes it so darn hard to get up.  _URL_1_ _URL_0_ edit: a word."
What would happen if an asteroid the size of the moon hit the earth?,"The asteroid that may have been responsible for the extinction of the dinosaurs had a diameter of about ~~170~~ 10-15 km. The moon has a diameter of about 3,500 kilometers. I'm not a scientist so I won't pretend to tell you exactly what will happen, but I think that it goes without saying this would be a catastrophe unlike anything seen before."

Why Nuking a asteroid that is headed for Earth is not a good strategy.,"Nuking an asteroid would be like taping an M80 to a boulder. Some postgraduate students from Leicester University did the math on the asteroid used in Armageddon (awful movie) it would take 800,000,000,000,000 terajoules of energy to blow up that chunk of rock. The largest nuke mankind ever set off only put out 418,000 terajoules of force. To nuke a large asteroid to the point of blowing it up you'd need 1.9 BILLION of the worlds biggest nukes. _URL_0_"
Why are Canada Geese called such instead of Canadian Geese?,"Because it's their name, not their nationality. If I live in New York, and my name is Bob France, you wouldn't call me French."
"With fight or flight, is there an effective way to overcome the freeze response?","Training. Specifically, what is known as ""stress inoculation.""  This is why new recruits in the military have to complete tasks while being yelled at and generally messed with by their instructors- a crude imitation of the stress of combat. It's why high quality police training involves responding to crises amidst all sorts of artificial stressors like simulated ammunition and panicked victims. It's why professional boxers get hit again and again and again long before stepping into the ring.  If you are routinely exposed to a certain kind of stress, you can become desensitized to it. Mental armor, so to speak. You can be trained to *act* when faced with stress rather than freezing up."
Did Rob Ford actually help the city of Toronto?,"[Here's a good article that goes over the positive outcome for Toronto](_URL_0_) tl;dr: While Ford's campaign was based on ""stopping the gravy train"", he never found one. Gravy leaked out of small cracks in municipal government. Ford saved $100,000 here and there by combining depts, etc. Didn't see it mentioned in the article, but ~$12mil saved by privatizing garbage collection. Started MUCH needed repairs on the elevated Gardiner Expressway (only highway that serves the direct downtown area). Nothing came out of it thanks to council and provincial government, but Ford was adamant about adding and expanding subway lines."
Why do basements/cellars tend to attract mold and mildew so much?,A cellar is usually colder then the outside as it is kept dark and surrounded by cold dirt. Humidity is based on not only the amount of water in the air but also the temperature of the air. So when air gets down into the basement and gets cooled down its humidity increases. All life needs water to thrive. Basements with a lot of humidity will have a lot more humidity so it is easier for mold to get the water it needs.
Is it possible to have more than one type of flu (bacterial or viral) running in your body at the same time?,"Just to clarify a little more... ""Flu"" does not just mean illness. It is specifically illness caused by *Influenza* viruses. In fact 'flu' is short for 'influenza'. The term ""bacterial flu"" is misleading because it means a bacterial infection occurring because your immune system has been weakened by the flu virus. So you can't have bacterial flu without having ""actual"" influenza caused by the influenza virus. So your answer is in your question. You can only have what is confusingly described as ""bacterial flu"" if you have viral flu. If you're using the word ""flu"" to describe any illness with similar symptoms then yes, you can definitely have as many infections as you would care to pick up. It will eventually kill you. Immune disorders (like AIDS) are such a problem because you end up with every disease and infection out there and it becomes impossible to stop the sufferer getting sick and dying from any and all kinds of infections."

"When people go outside to take a breath of fresh air, why does that help calm them down?","Going outside firstly removes the trigger and stimulus that's causing the stress - and so they can get out of an emotionally charged situation. Fresh air may also be a change in temperature, so they have a different physical response too, and that may help them breathe deeper, giving the stress hormones a chance to disperse"

"What does the term ""too big to fail"" mean?","It's a commonly used phrase to mean ""this company is so big and does so much business that if it were to fail and go under, it would have massive negative effects on the economy as a whole."" For example: We have a lot of banks in the US, but we have some *really really big* ones, too. When those banks started to fail, they were big enough that they caused massive, very bad effects to the economy of the *entire country* and frankly even extending out to foreign countries as well.  Since those companies are *too big to fail,* the government needed to step in and help them to not fail in order to prevent another Great Depression."
"If your voice sounds higher than what it sounds like to you, how can you sing the correct pitch?","Practice listening to yourself and *actually* hearing your own voice. Singing in a small, acoustically live room (like a bathroom) can help. I recommend purchasing some pvc pipe and making a small phone shape so that you can sing into one end and have it projected directly into your ear. I can almost certainly assure you it is not a biological problem."
Why are there no Grape flavored Yogurts?,"Chobani made a grape yogurt, but I don't think it sold very well. Grape and yogurt doesn't really mix in a way that is large scale marketable to consumers. Yogurt can be kind of sour, mixing that with grape is not a flavor many people can get behind."
Why is tinfoil (aluminum foil) so heat resistant?,"Heat resistent in what way? If you refer to ""Why doesn't it melt"", simply because it's melting point is incredibly high, much higher than your grill can produce (​(660.32 °C, ​1220.58 °F). If you are instead refering to ""Why doesn't it get super hot to the touch"" then you're building on a wrong premise: it isn't heat resistant at all and does get hot. It gets just as hot as the food underneath it. However tinfoil is so thin and so large that any heat that it does have dissapitates into the surrounding air almost instantly. Things that have little mass cannot hold as well to their energy as more massive things, and things with large surface area cool down faster than things that have lower area."
"How exactly does alcohol get you ""drunk""","Alcohol is a chemical that affects almost every organ in the human body, but in particular it interferes with the brains' cells abilities to communicate with each other. If you drink alcohol faster than your liver and kidneys can process it, it begins to build up in the bloodstream and hence gets carried to your brain, where it basically blocks some of the normal brain behaviour from occurring. [This paper explains alcohol's physical effects](_URL_0_) in a reasonably simple to understand format."
"How do nuclear launch codes work exactly, and can just about anyone use it?","This was covered in part by This American Life recently.  _URL_0_ ""So, here's the thing about the codes that people don't realize. It's not like he has a piece of paper in his pocket. It's like, here are the nuclear codes. It doesn't work that way. How it works is, there's a military officer that walks around with what's called a Football. That officer, he's got more experience than I do. And at the end of the day, if the president goes off the handle and says, nuke these guys because I don't like them, we're taught, in the military, as officers, that we have a moral obligation to refuse orders that are not moral. So if my commander tells me to do that, and it is not moral, I have an obligation to tell him to [BLEEP] off."""
Why do I always wake up early after a night of hard drinking?,"It also messes with your sleep cycle. I'm afraid I can't remember exactly how it goes about doing this, but I saw a documentary where the person who the sleep-scientists gave several large glasses of red wine ended up staying in REM and light sleep relatively longer, and only attaining deep sleep for a short time before coming back into lighter sleep at an early stage than normal"
Why are porn sites more likely to infect the user's computer with viruses than other sites?,"Impulse clicking. People are more likely to ignore warnings to see a naked chick than to read an insurance quote. The are also more likely to be embarrassed about what they were doing and not report it. Scammers know this, are are much more likely to use porn sites to deliver malware."
Why do loud noises seem to physically hurt? Is it all in our brain signals? Do deaf people feel pain from them?,"Pain is how our body signals to our brain that we're in a situation that's potentially causing us harm, so we're motivated to try to get out of that situation.  Loud enough noises can physical damage your ear, and as a result, we've evolved so that somewhere before the threshold of damage to our delicate ear parts, a loud enough sound will cross a pain threshold.  That pain is your ear telling your brain that being around these loud noises is bad for you, and you should try to get yourself away from them before your hearing is damaged."
How do GBA ROMS actually work? How do people recode entire games from Game Boys and DS' to work on the computer?,"This is actually very straightforward.  The ROMs are basically the software that's usually on the cartridge (or whatever medium).  They don't get recoded to run on a PC (or android, or whatever). People use emulators that pretend to be a Gameboy or DS or whatever, and the ROM thinks it's running natively.  And you can search to find answers to how emulators work."
How do carnivores like Tigers and Lions get enough nutrient balance by only eating meat?,"One, By eating things like blood, skin, organs, bones, etc. Obviously that animal they ate *contains all vitamins and minerals required for that prey animal to live* so consuming all, or most, of a prey animal will include a wider variety of vitamins and nutrients.  Humans can do this too, for example fish liver oil, whale blubber etc,. Whale blubber contains high amounts of vitamin C. Two, Different animals have different dietary needs. We primates require Vitamin C in our diets but we can manufacture other vitamins , many other mammals, including cats and dogs, *can actually synthesize their own vitamin C* so it isn't a dietary requirement.  Cats require vitamin A from animal sources, they cannot process carotenoids(from plants) into vitamin A. Dogs, and us, can eat a carrot and make vitamin A. Different animals have different needs and different capabilities to manufacture vitamins or to dietary input into essential compounds."
Why does some food get freezer-burned while others don't?,"Packaging. I wrap my stuff in plastic wrap, then foil, then a ziplock baggie and I never get it."
Pay-to-play politics,"It refers to how big donors get more access to politicians. If the average person contacts a national-level politician, they'll probably get a form letter reply from an intern. If someone who donated $20,000 contacts them, they'll get a call from the politician. High-level appointed positions are often given to big donors. Things like ambassador jobs to Caribbean island nations are one of the more common ones. But high-level advisory and even cabinet-level positions are often given to big donors too."
"when I want to type an apostrophe, I would hit the key next to the enter key on my keyboard and get this character ' but why does this alternate character ’ show up in text that I have copied off the web? Are they meant to be used interchangeably?","The prevailing wisdom is ' should be used for feet or minutes, while the curlier ’ should be used as a quote or apostrophe."
"Nowadays most money is digital, what prevents a bank to edit its computer records with another trillion $?","Digital money isn't just a number in a spreadsheet, it's an accounting of where the money came from. If there's no log showing that money was debited from one account and credited to another, it's not really there. Banks are regulated, audited, and taxed. Sure, a banker with enough seniority could probably create some fake money, and get away with it for a short time. But they wouldn't get away with it forever, because the numbers just wouldn't add up and before long somebody would figure it out and they'd go to prison."
How and why did the body associate tears with sadness?,"Without getting too technical, the short version is: When you are sad, your body released hormones(ACTH and Leu-enkephalin) through tears that can help you feel better(reduce stress and painkillers)."
Why do colors combine to make other colors?,"Colors are a response your brain makes to picking up certain wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation striking receptor cells in your brain. When this happens, those cells send signals to your brain, and your brain creates the image. Certain combinations of stimulation on those cells cause your brain to generate different colors, to help further discriminate, because this is a beneficial evolutionary adaptation (harder for things to blend together). Color itself is not a property of light or anything. Rather, a product of your brain interpreting it."
why is the Wilhelm scream so overused in movies?,"It's an inside joke/running gag. Sound mixing is a very tedious job, so they like to have fun. Like how Pixar movies almost have ""A113"" in their movies."
"When dieting and losing weight, is there a universal right way? Also do cravings mean something? And other ?","The right way is to utilize more calories than you consume. All diets that succeed do this, all diets that fail, fail to do this.  People may be more or less effective at eating less calories, or at burning more, but the equation is always the same.  It is possible that combinations of foods make you feel better or worse and that these things enable you to stick with it more. It is certainly healthy to avoid HF corn syrup in general, but from a pure weight loss perspective it is not all that important. Cravings can certainly happen with sugar swings, but again...thats about your ability to sustain a pattern of reduced calorie intake and increased calorie burning.  Eat the right number of calories. Then...eat a good balance of foods. Exercise. That's the recipe for both health and weight loss."
"Why ""Gravity"" Does Not Exist","Newton said gravity is a mysterious force that affects everything with mass. He didn't know what causes this force but he did create some useful equations. Then Einstein came up with General Relativity. He says that mass bends space-time and that's why things are attracted to each other. For Example, if you put 2 heavy balls on a trampoline, they warp the trampoline and move towards each other. This is just an analogy, but it helps give you the idea. This warping of space-time has some other side affects, which allows General Relativity to predict and explain thing that Newton's law doesn't (like small changes in the orbit of planets, light bending around stars, and clocks in GPS satellites running slower)."
"Some genes, increase the likelihood of getting certain diseases (like cancer) why?","It's kind of misleading to think of the gene as being exclusively for cancer-causing purposes. Typically the ""cancer genes"" people talk about are variations on a gene that codes for sometime useful.  Like when people say they have the BRCA1 gene (the gene most commonly associated with genetic breast cancers), they don't actually mean they have a genetic sequence in a place where everyone else has nothing. Everyone has a BRCA1 gene, it's just that normally it codes for tumor-suppressing proteins. In people with certain mutations in that region, however, the proteins that it codes for are not produced correctly and thus do not properly suppress the uncontrolled growth of cells."
What determines a person's sense of humor?,"Mostly psychological. When a person has good sense of humor, it generally means they are happy, socially confident and likely to have a healthy perspective on life. But this has exceptions because humor has a dark side. There are people who use self-defeating humor; also humor is used to criticize and manipulate others through teasing, sarcasm and ridicule. So being funny isn't necessarily an indicator of good social skills and well-being. It all depends on the kind of humor the person uses."
- How Do Solid State Hard Drives Work?,Flash drives work by having individual cells that are left with an electrical charge by depositing extra electrons (and thus negative charge) that is maintained even after power is removed. It's almost like a tiny series of microscopic batteries that is either set positive/negative or negative/positive. From an answer about general storage: _URL_0_
"Why do floppy disks and SD cards have a mechanical lock switch to block access, when anyone can just flip the switch and access the data inside?",The lock on floppies didn't deny access to the data. It locked out writing over it. It's more a a precaution to keep your data safe from yourself.
What is the definition of life?,"All known life has a few things in common, organisms (things that are alive) have these in common: they're composed of a cell or cells, undergo metabolism, maintain homeostasis, grow, respond to stimuli, and reproduce. There are a few things that seem to do a few but not all of these processes, like viruses, which is why they're classified as nonlife or as some kind of intermediate gray area between life and nonlife. We don't necessarily ""know"" nonlife mutated into life sometime in the past, but we view it as the most likely scenario because we do know that the Earth once had no life, and now, today, it does have life, and also because we know the processes it would have to undergo are theoretically possible."
Weird password policies,"Actually, your suggestion of a possible password might be safer. I vaguely remember some xkcd on this..."
Distillation as it pertains to alcoholic drinks,"Once the liquid that they are making the liquor out of has been fermented, and has alcohol in it, then the alcohol needs to be concentrated. Alcohol has a slightly lower boiling point than water, so they heat the liquid (which is called a mash by the way) to just below the boiling point of water. The alcohol boils off while the majority of the water remains liquid, separating the two. The alcohol vapor is then cooled and condensed back into a more concentrated and higher proof liquid. Then they generally age it in a barrel."
Why do we cover railway tracks with rocks ? Does it improve the stability when a train goes by ? (due to the vibrations),"Although it doesn't look it, the ballast is pretty solid. It distributes the load from the passing trains, keeps down unwanted vegetation (there aren't many plants than can grow on rocks) and enables water to drain away. This last one is very important. Where I live, there was some flooding back in May, and parts of the railway line were submerged. The water, having just washed down from the hillsides, was very muddy, and so the ballast is caked in mud. And so right now the line is closed for a couple of weeks while they clean the ballast. This is because the mud is preventing the water from draining away properly. In the winter, the wet mud would likely freeze, and water expands when it freezes: and so it might actually lift the tracks slightly. If we have a winter where the ballast freezes, unfreezes and freezes again a few times, that could loosen the tracks and make them dangerous."
"If I were to only rinse my body with water to clean myself, how clean would my body be?","Oils are not generally water soluble. Oils would be left on the skin after washing with just water, which would contribute to body odor and mangy hair. You would be cleaner than you went in, but soap is important."
Why do new cars smell the way they do?,because of left over chemicals from the plastics and the leather or faux leather treatments are evaporating into a mostly sealed environment
I tried to sign up for health insurance through _URL_0_ but I don't make enough money to get subsidized...what do I do? [from Florida],"If you do not make enough money to get subsidized, you may make little enough money to qualify for Medicaid.  Unfortunately, due to Florida's decision not to expand the Medicaid program, there is a gap between the maximum income to qualify for Medicaid and the minimum income to qualify for subsidies. If you fall within this gap, you probably will not be able to get affordable insurance. (You'll be exempt from the individual mandate, though, so you mostly just aren't affected.)"
how come there is thunder/lightning during storms but during blizzards/snowstorms there is no thunder?,"Actually, there is! [See this!](_URL_0_ snow)  That said, the reason you don't usually hear thunder during snowstorms is because snow actually suppresses the sound! It basically absorbs it, since it's just fluff in the air, drastically reducing the distance it can be heard! While a regular thunderstorm can be heard for miles and miles, a thundersnow is limited to just 2-3 miles of sound.  As for why it's so rare to see a storm like that? You need moisture in the air to produce a thunderstorm. In the summer this is easy, as warm air holds water better. Unfortunately, or fortunately, cold air holds less moisture, and as a result you need special conditions for thundersnow. A warm, wet front trailing or leasing a cold front can produce it.  Places like the gulf of Mexico will see it more often, due to readily available warm moist air!"
"Why do nuclear weapons create ""better looking"" mushroom clouds than other explosives?","Primarily scale. On a smaller explosive, the cloud will be, well, smaller. You'll be able to see all the little imperfections around its edges, and those imperfections will take up a larger proportionate area of the total structure. In a nuclear cloud, it's just so big that you don't notice the same-sized imperfection in the mushroom shape as much."
Power button on a smart phone,I suggest that you read a few button tutorials for embedded systems like arduino or raspberry pi. The processor can read the state of the buttons at any time. So they do this in a loop. When they notice the button is pressed they start a timer and wait for the button to be released. By measuring the time it takes for you to release the button they can do different functions. To save on battery they might not do it in a loop but rather have an interrupt logic in place that will signal the CPU whenever the state of a button changes and make it run the button checking logic. There may also be additional logic on the circuit board that detects if the power button have been held down for some time without the CPU reacting and do certain functions like toggling the power. This can be useful if the CPU have crashed or if the device is out of power.
How do our eyes coordinate to look at the same point and produce one image?,"There are tiny muscles in the eye socket to control your eyes movement. Due to evolution and natural select of ability to control where we look and how much control we have over fast-twitch muscle fibers, we are able to have our eyes turn to the same focal point and our brain merge the images together to produce our visual stimuli."
Can you really snap a neck like they do in the films?,"""asking for a friend."" Borrowing [this answer](_URL_0_), we learn: ""You have seven vertebrae in your neck (cervical vertabrae).  Breathing is controlled by nerves that come out above the third, fourth, and fifth vertebrae. Severing or severely injuring the spinal cord at this level will paralyze the diaphragm and keep you from breathing. It will also paralyze all other muscles below this level. Either the carotid or vertebral arteries supplying blood to the brain may also be damaged by the shear forces of the neck being snapped, referred to as dissection. This would cause ischemia to the areas of the brain supplied by those arteries. The most immediate cause of mortality in this situation would be respiratory arrest leading to cardiac arrest and death."" So, not exactly. But you have to remember that, in movies, bad guys fall down dead instantly from long-range gunshots, but good guys can take repeated blows to the head and body with blunt, heavy instruments with no apparent ill-effects."
Why are most holiday messages depersonalized?,"It's so that the card won't be limited to being from a single person or a group. ""Wishing you a happy holiday"" can come from either your single brother or from both your grandparents. If it said ""I wish you a happy holiday,"" groups and couples wouldn't buy that one, and vice-versa.  So the company that makes the cards would have to make multiple versions of the card. That incurs additional expense-- and, simply due to chance and demographics, one version would outsell the others, so they would have to try and calculate how much that discrepancy would be, in order to not produce not enough or too many of each one. Much easier to just make them more generic, so they make sense coming from either individuals or groups. The people giving the card can add personal messages that make any vagueness clear, anyway."
How are autonomous vehicles supposed to function in large cities (assumed to be where they'll be used most) when any normal gps system can't even function correctly with all the interference from the skyscrapers?,"They don't use JUST GPS. They also use cameras, sensors, and built in maps (and math). They are programmed to read signs, recognize pedestrians, keep an updated version of where they are on a map based on speed and direction, etc, etc..."
Why does inbreeding increase the likelihood of birth defects?,"Everybody has bad genes in them - I remember a scientist quipping that there are enough genetic defects in the human genome to kill a person several times over. However, all humans get two sets of genes, one from each parent. As a result, many of the 'defects' you might have in your genes are simply overridden by the working copy you got from your other parent. However, when you inbreed, you've got two people with very similar genetics, which means that its more likely that they'll both have identical copies of a defective gene (or gene set). That means the offspring is more likely to receive both copies of the defect from their parents, losing that protection that normally came from receiving two sets of chromosomes. Do not that inbreeding doesn't increase rates of mutations, just the likelihood of genetic defects that are already existing in the parents being expressed fully. Also, this question gets asked a lot. Use the search bar next time."
"Is at your own risk/we are not responsible for X Legal? If yes, to what degree?","Maybe, maybe not. My windshield was cracked from a spilled rock from a concrete mixer truck that had a sign that said ""Stay back 100 feet not responsible for broken windshields."" I contacted the company, explained in great detail which truck at what time on what street caused the damage and at the end of that 15 minute phone call they sent me to a glass company where they have an open account to have my windshield replaced at their cost."
Where is all the water going?,"The problem isn't that we're losing water, it's that we're just using clean freshwater faster than it's being replenished.

The recently annonced exotic hadrons made of 4 quarks.,"{Quarks carry color, antiquarks anticolor. These colors can be red, green or blue, RGB, and ofcourse also antired, antiblue, antigreen. Mesons are made of 2 quarks, a quark and its anti-quark, so that the resulting meson will be colorless (color + anticolor = colorless) Baryons are made of 3 quarks. (3 different colors, like RGB or aRaGaB are together colorless again) The exotic hadrons are made out of more than 3 quarks and that could be done like so: 4 quarks R, aR, B, aB (red + antired + blue + antiblue = colorless) 5 quarks RGB R aR (red green blue, red antired = colorless) So yeah normally the 4quark hadrons aren't more stable than two mesons of 2 quarks. so we call it exotic  }-ish"
Why are Canadians considered to be one of the nicest people? Did anything special happened? Is Canada such a nice place to live in?,"We help people all over the world.

Why does our body seem like it's exhausted when we oversleep?,"REM cycles. You oversleep, and your body's internal clock (regulates daily processes) gets screwed up so it rolls over to the next cycle and thinks you need to sleep. We need sleep to give our bodies time to repair without need for action, so they can do it freely and easily. Studies have shown that we can also solve problems we were thinking up the day before during sleep. It's basically a system repair daily to make sure we're good to go for tomorrow."
Why is building a fence/wall at the U.S. border considered foolish?,"Because the border is fucking HUGE. Seriously the border of the US and Mexico is almost 2,000 miles; for a comparison the entire border of France is ~1800 miles. Also it is just a fence and people can easily jump it like they do now where fences are in place.  And it will cost a shit ton, not only to build but to maintain."
Does the FBI really have a magical Google like in Criminal Minds?,"No, that's ust to make TV interesting. Dozens on people sitting quietly in cubicles for days or weeks searching for the info doesn't make good television."
How does the numbering on interstate exits work?,"Varies by state In some states, the exit corresponds with what the mile marker is. So if the exit is at mile marker 25, it's exit 25. In case of multiple exits or new exits added at mile 25, then it's subdivided into exits 25a, 25b, 25c, etc. In other states, the exits go in numerical order for the duration of the highway. There's an ordering system which runs east-west or north-south from lowest to highest. So the first exit is exit 1, second exit is exit 2, and so on til the end. When new exits are added, that's where you see exit 2a, 2b, 2c, etc."
Why do we see spots in our eyes after looking into a bright light?,"It's called an [afterimage](_URL_0_).

how do Wii remotes work? You point them at a small black bar and you can move the cursor anywhere on the screen.,"Actually, you can replace the sensor bar with two candles. The sensor bar is simply a device that emits infrared radiation, the Wii remote has an infrared sensor inside hs detects where the IR is coming from. Using that, it then uses Bluetooth to send that info to the Wii where it is displayed on the screen. Candles emit enough IR as well."
Is it possible to thrive on a 100% fungus based diet?,"Mushrooms are, indeed, awesome, but they don't have all the nutrients you need. They're very, very low in fat, for one (and yes, you do need some) and carbohydrates (and yes you need those too).  Mushrooms can definitely be good for you (especially if you eat a good variety if interesting ones and not ""plain"" white mushrooms), but you can't live just on them, I'm afraid."
The most recent physics noble prize,"It won for discovering strong evidence of gravitational waves. Usually things that cause fluctuations in gravity move too slowly to tell, but large, violent events cause waves: fluctuations in the gravitational field. These were predicted a century ago but it took these guys and a clever experiment to finally observe one.  Classic Newtonian understanding of gravity was that it would propagate infinitely: if you could instantly remove an object, the lack of gravity from it would be immediately felt. This experiment shows that it propagates at the speed of light, and radiates out like light or other forces."
What is the difference between Netflix's New Releases and Recently Added?,"Recently Added means that the content has only been added to Netflix's library recently but may have aired/been released on other platforms at any time before. New Release means the content has only been released on other platforms recently. For example, if Netflix added a tv show from the '60s yesterday, it would appear on Recently Added but if they added a season of a tv show that aired earlier this year, it would be new releases."
What is the difference between sutures and stitches?,"Same thing. Medical people usually call them sutures, and general public calls them stitches. The word ""stitches"" has a connotation of being on or of the skin, but same thing."
How do blind people know they are gay?,They know they are gay because they feel attracted to members of the same gender as themselves.
"If a cold is a viral infection, then why did paracetamol make my throat less sore?","Paracetamol doesn't do anything to any disease (except worsen liver diseases - check your doses kids). Basically all over the counter drugs are just there to mask symptoms. Sometimes treating symptoms is very important, like reducing a fever if it is too high, but they don't cure the illness."
"How/Why does cracking a glow stick ""activate"" it?","The ELI5 is this: A glowstick works by mixing two liquids which undergo a chemical reaction that produces light. The two parts are kept separate by a thin, fragile division inside the stick. Bending the flexible outer part of the stick cracks the inner division, allowing the two fluids to mix and start producing light."
How is Noise Pollution dangerous?,"Beyond the reality is that long term exposure to loud noises leads to deafness. There is a sense of social propriety as well. Just like you shouldn't walk down the street naked, and not let the smell of your shit disturb your housemates, you should show respect to others with regards to sound as well."
How is the wind capable of making 20 m high waves?,"The wind blows consistently over a very long distance of ocean. It isn't one single strong gust which blows a wave up, but a sustained force that puts lots of energy into the wave."
how come things that are blurry due to motion in rel life can look clear in mirrors?,"Our eyes are simply better at tracking motion that is further away. From the perspective of your brain, the fan in the mirror is twice as far away from you."

"Why are 3d models used for games, in a T-Pose when not in use or before an animation ?","It's the best way to model or sculpt it. it's also more or less a standard, so you can easily take a skeleton from another model and place it on your working model. It allows for easier deformation modelling too. You can also model a character with their arms down, but then when you want to animate those arms upwards the deformation becomes a lot harder to get right."
Why do we read Shakespeare? Isn't the point of a theatrical play to watch it?,"Well that's where imagination comes into play, you can basically watch the play in your head while reading - in fact a lot of 'plays' are specifically written to be read as 'armchair theatre'"

Why all the hate for Joss Whedon's handling of Black Widow in Avengers: Age of Ultron?,"She got captured and put in a cage by a male villain. Partly because ScarJo got pregnant during filming and they had to write her out of some action scenes, but when the only woman on the team is the one who gets kidnapped and needs a man to rescue her, it seems off. That, combined with the addition of a romantic subplot annoyed people who liked that for once, a female lead in a film didn't need a love story to be cool.  Oh, and the line about being sterilized got interpreted by some fans to mean ""Because I can't have kids, I am a monster."" Instead of as ""I can't have kids, because of the horrible things they did to me, which resulted in my being a monster."" Which offended women who thought this meant Whedon was treating women as baby-factories who have no worth unless they are pumping out children. So this, combined with the internet amplifying people's anger and rage, lead to so many angry tweets."
How is Russia able to afford its current modernization program?,"The available resource right in mainland and doesnt have to import, Russia with its vast land is very resource rich, so it's more cost-effective to self supplying some of the industries, making the product costs lower comparing to other countries. Furthermore, the cost living in Russia is lower than other western countries, although their social welfare isnt as good, but still acceptable in their own standard. And finally, being a somewhat ""dictator ship"", they can easily cut the money at some departments and transfer it to their higher priority one. It's the same with NKorea, where 60% people in starving thread, and still can launch rocket, although quality is questionable. Russia is way more bigger than NK, and has more experience in dealing with trouble from WW2. In motherland everything can happen."
Why are people of Nordic origin taller than most humans?,Somebody has to be the tallest. That area of the world happened to get mutation for height.
"If cellphones are replacing landlines, why aren't there versions of white pages for cellphones? How are landlines any different?","Problem Is there are multiple cell phone companies, so if each had their own book it would be incomplete and inconvenient to have to look through 5 books to find a person. Land lines used to be one company in an area generally. It was a weird deal because they were a company, but a utility and basically a monopoly. Even after it was deregulated it still stayed much the same. And even if someone does somehow arrange to get one combined cell list, it's still going to be very incomplete because people could choose to be unlisted and a large percentage would. I know I would."
"Is ""dream Deja Vu"" a thing?","One of the prevailing theories on Déjà Vu is that sometimes our wires get crossed (metaphorically) and the sensory input goes through the region of our brains for memory formation and recall before going to conscious thought. I mind tags information based off of where it came from, so it sees that some of the stimuli came from our senses, but the similar stimuli came from our memory. It makes us feel like we've seen this exact before, when it's all coming from the same input."
what is the theory behind juries? Why can't judges just make all the decisions?,"The idea behind juries is that you don't want to turn judges into an elite ruling class that has total power over people. That kind of power is easy to abuse. Plus, laws are supposed to be a reflection of society itself determining what rules it wants to follow, so having ""society itself"", in the form of a jury of the accused's peers, determine whether or not the law was broken seems only fitting."
Why did the Earth form with just a single continent?,"It didn't.... I'm guessing that you're referring to Pangaea which is usually the starting point when teaching about Continental Drift, however the continents were separate before they formed the supercontinent Pangaea.  In fact, Pangaea is actually thought to have been the seventh or eighth [supercontinent](_URL_0_)."
"How is it possible to know precise details about planets that are many lightyears away, but not to know the exact size of pluto?","One is a precise measurement based on brand new data on an object that is almost perfectly dark and is extremely small.  The other is a broad, sweeping guess based on a humongous object that is glowing almost as bright as the sun.  I don't see the problem here."
How (or why) is the US Federal Reserve not an actual part of the government?,"The Federal Reserve is essentially a government agency that is operated privately. It was created by the government, it's leaders are appointed by the government, but it is independent. This is often referred to as being ""independent within the government.""  By making it independent and quasi-private, the Federal Reserve can run monetary policy more efficiently, without every single thing being politicized and subject to constant interference and squabbling from politicians. This isn't to say that there's no oversight, just that it's less silly."
Why hats used to be so popular in the 1920's and 30's,"Hats have been popular articles of men's attire from ancient times until 1960. Most men throughout history wore a cap or hat whenever they went outside. In 1960, President-Elect Kennedy attended his inaguration hatless and thereafter fashion changed rapidly to dispense with headgear except as environmental conditions required. From about 1920 to 1960 men found it increasingly hard to use hats as an article of fashion due to the headroom in cars. As the headroom got smaller, hats got harder to wear. First the large tophat style hats vanished, then even smaller fedoras. About the only place men still feel comfortable wearing headgear in transport is in the cab of large trucks."
why Verizon workers are going on strike?,"The Verizon employees who are on strike have not had a contract since August of 2015. Negotiations with the company have not produced the results they felt were appropriate and they have elected to strike based on that. Some of the issues they have raised are wages, pension freezes, Verizon working to make it easier to dismiss staff and move jobs overseas, among other things."
Why do omelets and scrambled eggs taste differently even though I put the same ingredients into them?,"First, texture has a lot to do with food. The sensations of chewing, moving food around in your mouth, and taking a bite-sized solid piece of omelet versus a fluffy bit of scrambled egg with a lot of air in it will add to a difference in flavor. Next, your omelet usually has a big chunk of ""other stuff"" in its middle whereas the scrambled egg approach would have little bits of other things all throughout them (assuming you are making them with more than just cheese). This changes the way those additional bits cook and exchange tastes with each other, changes their moisture content, and changes the distribution of flavours that you get in each mouthful. Finally, scrambled eggs are mixed around and they're cooked very uniformly without a ""browned"" exterior, but omelets usually have a little more deep-cooking in their exterior surface, and its different more-burned chemicals can result in a different flavor profile."
Why aren't independent votes counted in the presidential primary?,"Right now the parties are voting to pick who they want to run for president, as private entities. They may want to exclude non-party members, for instance to avoid letting 'guerilla voters' bump up a cataclysmically bad candidate so that the party will nominate him/her, and then lose in the general election. You aren't currently voting *for president.* When that time comes, you can vote for whoever you'd like."
Why does cereal need to be in a bag in a box when dry pasta doesn’t need a bag before being put into a box?,"We want cereal to stay crisp, because we don't intend to cook it before eating it. And because it has loads of rough surface area, it absorbs humidity fast."
"Can Chinese writing be ""sounded out?"" How would someone read a word that they've never seen before.","No, mandarin and cantonese are not phonetic. If you can't figure out the word, you have to look it up or use context."
Why do charities build new homes for the homeless/under-privileged when we already have a ridiculous amount of vacant homes in the US that could be fixed/don't need fixing?,"You can't really ask the government to just let you take existing but currently uninhabited homes like that, it'd basically amount to stealing from the owner. Some places have laws about letting property be considered properly 'abandoned' in which case any supposed owner that fails to maintain the property can lose it to someone that does, but that's not universal or necessarily easy. Ignoring that, though, where are these empty houses? A lot of them are somewhere pretty useless for a homeless person. Having a home doesn't mean much if you can't get a job in the area to hold down the home. Just giving homes to homeless people and calling it a day won't really work - you have to address the fact that most homeless people are facing issues of which being homeless is more of a symptom than a direct problem. Mental health issues, disability, inability to get work, etc."
"Why do relatively small similarities between songs or books result in lawsuits worth millions, but knock-off food items can have identical ingredients, similar packaging, and even reference the name brand being ripped off with ""compare to < brand name > ""?",Songs are protected by copyright which protects the song from people copying it. Food on the other hand is a product that is composed of ingredients that are most likely not under patent protection. Also many of the generic brands you mention are actually made by the same company they are trying to imitate. The company just makes a lesser quality version of the name brand for stores to sell as a cheaper version.
"What does the ""real"" in real estate mean?","It means ""actual"" in the sense that the thing is a permanent part of the world, as opposed to ""personal estate"" or ""personal property"" which comes an goes. _URL_0_ Yes that's not how we use the word ""real"" usually today, but it was a long time ago."
Why is anal sex called anal sex and not rectal sex? (NSFW),For the same reason oral sex is not called throat sex.
Why does it hurt so much to get kicked in the balls?,"Evolutionarily, our whole purpose in life is to live long enough to raise children, our genes don’t really care what happens after that. Our entire pain/reward system has been tweaked to this purpose. You ate? Good job, here is some dopamine. You skinned your knee? Bad job, that could get infected and kill you have some pain.  Based on this logic, pretty much the worst thing you could do is damage your ability to reproduce, so your balls are absolutely packed with nerve endings that will send intense pain signals to your brain if they sense injury, because losing your reproductive ability is equally as bad as death."
What happens to medicines beyond their expiry date that they turn unsafe for consumption?,Most everything has chemical reactions as they age. Some medications get weaker so the medicine simply stops working correctly. Some become more powerful so you risk overdose. And some completely change and can either lose their effect or become toxic.
How exactly is a file deleted from your computer?,"The computer (the operating system) keeps a list (index) of the files, the name and the location on the disk. When you ""delete"" the file, the computer marks that entry as no-longer-needed. It doesn't delete the entry, nor does it alter the actual file at all. Next time it needs to store something on the disk, it looks for available space; if it find an entry that says ""deleted"", it will overwrite the entry and overwrite as much of the file space as it needs. The recycle bin is simply another ""list"" that points back to all the files that say ""deleted"" in the real file list. When you ""empty"" the recycle bin, you're deleting this extra list, but not changing anything in the real list.  For bonus complexity: disk space is assigned in ""clusters"". A file that takes only 100 bytes will actually take (perhaps) 4,000 bytes on the disk. But the computer will only actually write the first 100 bytes - the other 3900 byes will still be the original, deleted, file."
how are people in many societies expected to find love and marry by their early 20s?,"Basically, when everyone is aware they must be married by 21, people compromise and settle quickly. Some of the prettiest or most socially dominant people in highschool (or equivalent age) would have first pick, then their friends would feel the need to catch up, and so on, until very nearly everyone had someone just because it's not fashionable not to.  Imagine if you could only ever sleep with your highschool prom date ever again, and if you didn't have one, that was it, you would have to go become a monk. You would imagine that a lot of people would make do with a decent prom date, and that sometimes people would marry only out of fear of being alone."
Why is Ellen Pao hated?,"Since the subreddit ban wave (Fatpeople hate ect.) reddit decided she was satan, and never really came back from that.  Some people believe she's commercializing reddit and steering it away from its roots.  Personally I don't think we have the information to read her character one way or the other."
Grafite and diamond are made of the same thing. Why one is transparent and other not?,"In a diamond, the carbon atoms are all neatly lined up in a crystaline structure. Photons entering the lattice work from the right angles will pass right through it virtually unimpeded. In graphite and other forms of carbon, the lattice work isn't there, and the atoms are in what you'd call a pile. So photons encounter resistance no matter where they hit it."
How can you identify musical meter?,"Other repetitive patterns, such as loudness of notes, in pop music, bass and snare drum hits are closely synced to the meter.  Listen for arpeggios on bass, guitars or pianos that are multiples of the meter. If music is less rhythmic, like just long slow legato notes on violins or synth pads, it will be harder to recognize. There is a less emphasized ""downbeat"" for you to find"
How do bees make such perfect hexagons?,"That is just what happens when you cram a bunch of circles together. Bees make circular/cylindrical containers for their honey and eggs, since those have the most volume to wall material ratio. When these are all smushed together you get hexagons."
Why have I never heard of someone getting heart cancer?,"It's just a very, very rare form of cancer so it's not heavily talked about. _URL_0_ Apparently the drummer of Kiss died from it, though."
Where does the energy go to when you have a fully charged device and it is still plugged into the wall?,"This is how I've been told to think about it: it's not that the power plug is PUSHING power out to the device, it's that the device battery is PULLING power from the plug. When the battery is 'full', it stops PULLING thereby eliminating any further flow of electrons. Can anyone confirm?"
What causes a mob mentality?,"It is herd mentality. I nature it goes like ""everyone else is terrified and running away so I should also be terrified and running away"". There for in an angry mob everyone around you is angry, shouting and swearing ect so subconsciously you also feel you should be doing just this. Such mentality, as you called it, causes angry crowds to do things that individuals wouldn't and riots emerge."
Why Mexico did not become a powerful nation just like Canada or the US?,"As a Canadian, I think the word you're looking for is *affluent,* not powerful."
What do the reduced salt signs on highways and roads mean?,"Highways are sprayed with a salt solution in winter to prevent the formation of ice. Certain sections of highway are near water supplies and protected wilderness areas however. These sections are salted less in order not to contaminate the surrounding ecosystems. They put the signs up to warn you that because there's less salt, there will likely be more ice."
solving differential equations,"Hey brohan, solving Differentials is just like integrating derivatives. Cake. So first, just look at my name. It is a differential equation by itself, dy/dx = e^x.  1st step you need to do is make sure all the y is one 1 side and all the x is on the other side. So my equation turns to dy = e^x dx. Now you can integrate to get rid of the dx, and you will get: y = e^x That's it. Now, there might be more complicated problems, but basically, just try to simply everything so that you can easily integrate, and make sure you group the terms on different sides."
Why does travel in a bus/train make me feel tired?,I believe it's from the constant adjustments your body has to make from being bumped around. You never get the opportunity to sit still like you would on a couch.
"If women's cycles sync up when they spend some time together, wouldn't every women be theoretically on the same monthly cycle?","I think they would have to spend a lot more time together than you imagine, like maybe live together and spend a lot of time outside work/college with each other also."
Why can't they make space elevators with propellers on them to reduce tension forces?,"That would only work in the atmosphere, where the propellers have something to push: air. But the cable will experience the same amount of tension above the atmosphere, where there is no air for the propellers to push. The only real solution is to find a way to manufacture, in large quantity at reasonable cost, a material with the necessary tensile strength."
Why does the visible light spectrum appear cyclic to the human eye if the spectrum is based on specific linear wavelengths of light?,"Just to add something extra to the excellent explanation already provided... Our color vision is usually a matter of our vision system interpolating between the colors detected by our three flavours of cones in our retina. Think of it like a triangle, with red, green and blue in the corners and all the other colors somewhere in the middle. But then consider that a small percentage of human females are ""tetrachromats"". For them, there are 4 types of color receptors in their retina. For them, the perceived color is interpolated between 4 different points. You have to imagine this in 3d now, like a 3 sided pyramid with 4 point of detected color, and some interpreted color point somewhere in the 3d space of the pyramid. Tetrachromats may be able to distinguish 100 million colors ... _URL_0_"
"How did gold, silver, and bronze specifically become the iconic symbols of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd in competitions.","Being both common and given value. Bronze is a mix of copper and... On mobile, but I want to say iron. Looks nice, but isnt all that valuable. Silver is more valuable, but tarnishes. Gold is a symbol of wealth and purity, and is the most valuable of the three. Other materials are not as common, harder to work with, or either too valuable to give up, or too cheap to mean anything."
Why does clips of American news seem such poor quality on UK TV?,"The UK and the US have two different systems for broadcast TV signals. The US uses a system called NTSC, and the UK uses a system called PAL. PAL is slightly better than NTSC to start with, but converting an NTSC signal to PAL degrades it even further. All the major US networks now broadcast an HDTV signal as well. That should be directly compatible with an HDTV broadcast in the UK and the quality should be indistinguishable. But I have no idea what the agreements are between the US news outlets and the British news outlets to exchange video clips so it may be that whatever source you're using for news is limited to NTSC clips."
Why can't we flush toilets with saltwater?,"That would necessitate two different water sources coming to your house and an additional plumbing system to keep your toilet separate from your sinks, showers, etc."
"Why does GPU drivers update, if the GPU is the same? What will that hcange?","The hardware and software have to work together. The hardware never changes, but the software can change and evolve over time to offer better performance, more features, or in some cases even to fix minor errors in the hardware manufacturing process. Almost ever time there are new drivers released they increase performance. Sometimes the drivers include specific alterations to make a specific set of games run better, sometimes they just generally make all programs run better."
How did we get metal to think? How does it know what the 1's and 0's are? Is it at it's core mechanical?,"> How did we get metal to think?  By: * building an electrical component (transistor) where a voltage on one line can act as a very fast switch on a different line. * finding a super-miniuaturized production process for these components. * wiring them together in increasingly complex systems to store numbers, do calculations on those numbers and come up with calculations we can interpret as ""thinking"".  > How does it know what the 1's and 0's are?  It doesn't. Even the 0 and 1 are human interpretation of electrical charges and voltages.  > Is it at it's core mechanical? No, it is at its core electrical."
Why is soda a soothing chaser for alcohol?,"The carbonation helps to disperse remaining alcohol from the palate and tongue.  Plus, it has a sugary taste."
"What is ""development hell""?","> ""Development hell or development limbo is media industry jargon for a state during which a film or other project remains in development without progressing to production. A film, video game, television program, screenplay, computer program, concept, or idea stranded in development hell.""  TL;DR When a game/film is not making any progress/being scrapped and restarting, Example: completely starting from scratch over and over Source: Google/Being a developer."
How did herbivorous dinosaurs get so large while have so little protein in their diet?,"Part of what allows Herbivores to grow as large as they do is that the Digestive Systems in Herbivores are optimized for extracting every bit of protein available from the food they eat. Their digestive tracts can also make some proteins from food that lack proteins. A good example is a a cow's Digestive Tract: It has four stomachs, all for getting the most nutrient possible out of every bite.  Also, plants aren't necessarily devoid of protein. Plants have Keratin, which most predators, and humans, can't digest. Herbivores however, usually can digest it. This greater diversity to what a Herbivore can eat allows them to have access to a surprising amount of protein and nutrients."
"How do bytes take up ""space""?","Your hard drive is a round plate, kind of like an old record. It's divided into thousands and thousands of ""sectors"", tiny little spots.  Each one of those tiny spots is a byte... When you save a byte on your hard drive, the drive head makes a change in the magnetic charge in that spot. The computer turns these positive and negative magnetic charges into ones and zeroes."
Why the Winter War happened,"Relations between Russia and Finland had been strained since WWI.  Russia felt that Finland was weak, and that they would be able to easily seize a decent chunk of territory. Most of the rest of Europe was distracted by Germany gearing up to start WWII, and so the Russians felt that nobody else would really do much to help Finland if they invaded."
How does light transfer data in optical fibers?,"When data is transmitted over a wire, the wire is turned on and off very quickly. Thousands of times per second, it checks if the wire is currently on. If the signal is off, that is interpreted as a 0. If it's on, that's a 1. Light travels through fiber optic cables. It's basically done the same way, but instead of electricity it uses flashes of light."
Can anyone launch a satellite? Or are there laws claiming space territory?,"Per the [Outer Space Treaty](_URL_0_) of 1967, governments cannot stake a claim to territory in space—so yes, space is indeed borderless. However, to get to outer space, Spacex's rockets first have to pass through the airspace directly above the US, which the Federal Aviation Administration *does* have jurisdiction over, thus requiring their approval."
How is child pornography taken down so efficiently from all over the web while it's so easy to find for instance pirate movies & TV series?,Police actively enforce the Child Pornography issues so its forced to go much much more underground and its generally illegal everywhere. Piracy is a copyright issue. A police officer cant arrest you for just being in possession of a digital copy of a movie. The owner of the copyright has to put a claim against you etc. Its more complicated and then they can charge you etc. It just being online isn't in and of itself illegal right off the bat.
what do the different temperatures on a washing machine do to my clothes?,"Hot water generally cleans better but ages the clothes faster. Unless it's stained, I wash cold/cold and hang all my good shirts, shorts, and pants to dry. Warm *should* wash fastest, since it should fill the washer faster. YMMV. If you follow the care labels on your clothing they will last a lot longer than if you warm wash everything and machine dry everything on normal or heavy settings."
What kinds of things do high-priced lawyers do that get better results for their clients than what public defenders are able to do?,"When you pay for a high price lawyer, you're paying for skill and time. An expensive lawyer has several paralegals working under him that can spend a lot of time digging through old court cases looking for cases like yours. Once the lawyer has these cases, he can craft an argument based on them stating why you are innocent or deserve a lighter sentence."
What is the margin of error?,"in statistics, its very hard to get an exact number. Most of the calculations for certain statistics come with that factor, a margin of error. Its basically the amount of possible variance in the answer. so 20% with a margin of error of 5% means the actual answer could be from 15%-25% but its definitely somewhere in there."
how do silencers on guns work?,"The bullet is launched out of the gun by an explosion that superheats the air and produces a loud BAM sound. The gas/air that carries that sound wave doesn't have anywhere to go except out with the bullet. A silencer basically extends the barrel and helps that ""explosion air"" diffuse in other directions so that the resulting explosion from the gunshot is much quieter. Movies and games that have a ""pew pew pew"" sound with the silencer attached are doing it wrong - it really is still an explosive sound, just heavily subdued, like a brick hitting a sandbag or something."
why aren't all toilets tankless (like the ones in commercial buildings)?,Homes generally do not have access to the high flow water sources required to make one of those toilets work.
Why do Republicans want to repeal The Affordable Health Care Act so badly?,"It's not really a giant health insurance plan, it's a bunch of reforms to the health care system, one of which being an online marketplace where you can buy private health insurance. The main issue that Republicans have is that one of the reforms is that having health insurance is now mandatory, and there will be a tax penalty for anyone who chooses not to buy it."
Why are we grossed out by the thought of our family members having sex or masturbating?,"For sexually reproducing species, incest is often problematic because closely related family members are likely to share genetic problems with you that are then exacerbated in the children of incestuous couples. For this reason, many species have some sort of control against incest, typically behavioral. In humans, that control is revulsion at the idea of having sex or even thinking about sex with people who we had close contact with growing up. If we were not disgusted by envisioning family members engaged in sexual acts we might instead be aroused. This would create an evolutionary pressure against the aroused group because their children and their children's children wouldn't be able to breed as well and the family arousal trait would be out-competed by the the family disgust trait."
Why do sour foods make faces move involuntarily?,"Many sour foods are poisonous, we are programmed to reject sour foods with ""disgust"", same as when you see other unhealthy things like feces and Kanye West.  There was a good BBC Horizon show on Disgust years back. I found this article. _URL_0_"
Why are dreams so much more vivid if you wake up during them?,"Your brain actually tries to forget dreams. Most people have more than three per night, and forget most of them. If you wake up during a dream, your brain hasn't had time to try to forget it. Partially forgotten dreams, either by waking up before the memory has faded or by the mind failing to completely forget it, will seem much duller than a fresh dream."
Why don't people get drunk on rubbing alcohol?,Ethyl alcohol sold as rubbing alcohol is denatured. Meaning it's mixed with poisonous and disgusting tasting substances to make it undrinkable. The additives are also selected to ensure that it's difficult to purify the alcohol with distillation.
What motivates people to write thousands/millions of lines of code for open source software for free?,"I like to think of OSS developers as in two categories 1 - People actually EMPLOYED to do work, and are legally obligated to submit their work back into the OSS source tree for whatever reason 2 - Weekend Warriors, College Kids or Bored Teenagers with nothing to do and kind of ""get off"" on seeing people use their creation and commit something to the greater good. They like solving complex problems, and doing something cool that others can use is a great feeling"
Why Bing is so poor compared to Google search engine and showing no sign of catching up or improving,Bing is actually excellent at certain things. But my interest in it is usually short-lived.
Can I build the internet from scratch?,Connect two computers with a network cable. Bam! Your very own personal Internet!
Why does only your own saliva take out your own blood in fabric (like a tshirt)?,"Not true at all. Even if saliva can remove blood (it can, but so can water), whether or not it comes from the same source as the blood makes absolutely no difference."
Exactly how is smoking weed different from eating edibles. Not in your mind but chemically.,When you eat it it gets processed by your liver into 11-hydroxy-THC. Which is said to be 5 times more psychoactive than when you smoke or vaporize cannabis.
Why is Bill Cosby not in prison yet?,"Because 1. The statute of limitations for the crimes Cosby is accused of has passed. 2. Because given the length of time between the acts and now, there is little chance of there being enough evidence to prove his guilt ""beyond a reasonable doubt."""
Is Irish a race or a nationality?,"That's ridiculous. Irish is a nationality. They might say those kids aren't Irish because they don't have the right accent it don't follow the traditions, it happens in all closed communities, but they are as Irish as the taoiseach (current or past). It has nothing to do with race."
Why aren't Chinese people typically fat? We eat so much rice on a near daily basis.,"The answer is extremely simple: a modest number of total calories per day. (Often combined with a decent amount of exercise through work, walking, and/or cycling.) No matter what *kind* of food you eat, if the *total calories consumed* don't exceed the number you burn, you cannot get fat."
Where do the newborn babies in television come from?,Most babies you see on TV are actually a lot older than you think. Most are at least a few months old.
"if cameras take square photos, why are the apertures round?","You've sort of got it the wrong way round. The camera LENSES are round, because round lenses bend light much better. But the film the image is captured on is rectangular, for the same reason that all pictures are usually rectangles, easier to frame and they are easier to put onto walls. Modern camera sensors have just continued this. Also when light is bent by a round lens, the images around the edges are often distorted, by using rectangle sensors you are just cropping these out and getting a better image."
What has caused Brazil to become as major of a country as it is?,"They have a large area, large exploitable population, lots of natural resources, and are politically stable."
"Why do they say to ""breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth"" when exercising?","When you breathe in through your nose you're filtering the air before it goes into your lungs, and pulling it through a smaller opening, forcing you to inhale slower taking deeper breaths. You exhale through your mouth because it's a bigger opening and you want to get the 'bad air' out as fast as you can.  Your nose also helps regulate the temperature of the air you're breathing. When it goes in your mouth it goes very quickly into your lungs, and if it's too cold it can be jarring to your lungs. I'd guess, when it's way too hot out, like today, it also serves to cool it down a bit."
"The naming conventions of sea vessels, HMS, SS, RMS etc.","HMS - His/Her majesty's ship - British Royal Navy USS - United states Ship - US Navy SS - Steam Ship - not necessarily powered by steam, designation for Us merchant ships Each country has their own traditional ship designations. NATO also has designations for Navy ships from all nations"
"If Republicans are such terrible leaders (responsible for govt shutdown, etc) why are they still elected?","In the US, people tend to think everyone in congress is a bunch of idiots...except their guy. The guy they voted for is the one voice of reason trying to find common sense solutions and everyone else is out for themselves."
Why hasn't there been a viable 3rd Party in American politics to date?,"It's because of the ""first past the post"" method of determining the winner. Whoever gets the most votes wins, rather than the candidate having to secure a simple majority of 50% plus one. Third parties end up skewing the results and acting as ""spoilers"". There have been successful third parties — the Republican Party, for one. There's also the matter of the two main parties doing everything they can to keep viable third party candidates off the ballot or handicapped in one way or another. Ranked choice voting is one solution to this rather undemocratic feature of our system."
What is blood type? Why is our blood different?,"Not quite 5, but I'll give it a shot. Blood type refers to the type of cell marker that exists on the outside of your red blood cells. There are 3 types- A, B, and O. If you have A, B is considered foreign so you will have anti-B antibodies. The same can be said for A if you have B type blood.  If you have O, it is neither A nor B so you make antibodies for both A and B.  AB blood types have no antibodies since both types are present on their cells.  Type ABs are referred to as ""universal recipients"" because they have no antibodies in their blood and can therefore receive any type of blood without fear of the body rejecting it. Type Os are the universal donors under most condition but this can vary depending on other more complicated factors since as I mentioned before they have anti-A and anti-B antibodies. These types are genetic. A and B are dominant to O, and if you get an A from one parent and a B from another, you will be AB (co-dominant)."
Why is my graphics card so big compared to my CPU?,"Your graphics card has it's own RAM. Your CPU's RAM is on the motherboard. Technically you're counting the GPU, it's board, and RAM, and cooling stuff as one thing. So if you do that with the CPU too, the CPU is much bigger since its board is the motherboard."
Why are terraced houses in New York and possibly other places elevated?,"They have lower levels (originally servants quarters) besides the main entrance, they usually go below street level. Every place is different, but I would assume that the underground pipping as well as water level do not allow for basements of considerable depth, which is why he main level is above street level. These lower levels have their own exterior door and are rented out."
Why does daycare cost so much when the teachers are paid so poorly?,It's for much the same reason that private schools are very expensive: teachers' salaries are only a small portion of the costs of operating the business. Add to this these costs:  * Supplies * Rent for the facilities * Administrative costs (licensed daycares have to cope with mountains of paperwork to comply with state and local laws) * Taxes * FICA/Medicare for employees * Training for the teachers * Liability insurance * Legal counsel * Employee benefits (if provided) * etc.
What is the controversy of CrossFit exercise programs?,It's olympic lifts (good) but focused on speed and reps at the expense of form and safety (bad).
What is the weight of gravity in pounds and how to find it?,"Gravity is a force, while weight is the effect of gravity on a given mass. You cannot convert gravity in to weight. It's like asking me to tell you the speed of your car using only the measurement of how much gas you have in the tank."
"Why can't ""We the People"" petition to have the NSA shut down (and it actually work..)?","That would be a [direct democracy](_URL_0_). The United States of America is a representative democracy, the people's voice is heard by proxy of their representative."
Why don't we sue politicians for broken election promises as breach of verbal contract?,"There is a saying that a verbal contract isn't worth the paper its printed on. But beyond that humorous quote, there is a better reason.  An elected official can simply say that the situation or information changed in the time between the campaign and the vote, which is a great defense, because that's how we want our representatives to act."
"EL 5, How is it that ""polar bear"" clubs can go swimming in January and not die of hypothermia?","They basically just go in and out of the water, and they're prepared with towels and warm clothes as soon as they're done. Even in near-freezing water, it takes at least 10-15 minutes for hypothermia to happen. Also, at least in the bigger polar bear clubs, there's medical staff around in case of emergencies."
Til Death do us Part. Do religious people believe they are all single in Heaven?,"This is coming from a Christian perspective, but marriage is seen as an earthly example of our relationship with Christ, we find fulfillment in caring and loving on our spouse and we get the benefit of them doing the same for us. Now once we get to heaven we are completely and entirely fulfilled by God for He is our ultimate desire of the relationship we were seeking on earth. Now we still get to chill with our loved ones but it marriage is no longer needed like it was, sorry if that was too preachy, hope that makes sense"
Vulgar Latin and it's difference between Classical Latin,"Vulgar Latin uses more vocabulary that made it into modern Romance languages, and the sentence structure is often more like the modern Romance languages too. So stuff like: occasionally, you'll see the relative pronoun (qui quae quod) used to mark indirect discourse instead of accusative + infinitive constructions. The pronunciation is also different, but that probably won't matter in your class. Most people I've spoken to have said they found Mediaeval Latin 'easier' than Classical Latin. And the subject matter is often more church-focused, so you'll run into lots of new ecclesiastical vocabulary often borrowed from Greek (eg episcopus for bishop, angelus for angel/messenger (of God)), or new meanings for old words (eg Dominus for the Lord, God, rather than the head of a household)"
I've never seen a fat bird. Is that because flying is vital for them to survive so natural selection kills them or because birds simply don't get fat?,"People commenting here don't know what they're talking about. Birds do get fat the closer you get to the cold extremes (arctic, mountain peaks). You've never seen one because, I assume, you haven't been to these types of places. Furthermore, you wouldn't know how fat the bird is until you kill and butcher it, but I promise, there are fat birds. Yes, flight is a big part of their survival, but so is fat in the cold weather. As with most things, there's a balance. When colder season come, birds store fat. Not enough that they cannot fly anymore, but they do store fat. When it's time to migrate, a lot of that fat gets burned off."
How does paracetomol work?,"The mechanism of action for Paracetamol/acetomenophen is not entirely understood. It *probably* inhibits COX, which is an enzyme that is part of the chemical pathway for chemical pain signals in the body. Inhibit the enzyme, the body makes less pain-signalling chemicals."
"Why is ""I don't like sand"" line from Attack of the Clones considered so bad?","It's supposed to be Anakin's smooth line to use on Padme and it's just so derpy and cringeworthy. Lucas has such a tin ear for dialogue that Harrison Ford said to him, ""You can type this shit, George, but you can't say it."""
Do you need a computer to create a computer?,"Assuming that all humans alive today survived, there's a tremendous amount of knowledge and experience that could be used to quickly bypass lots of steps along the way. As an example of this, check out [the best Commodore 64 games](_URL_0_) from the mid 1980's, and compare that to the winners of the [2010's Commodore 64 Demoscene](_URL_1_) where people take all of the advances in programming from the last 30 years and apply them to old hardware. It's true that modern computers are designed and built in part by computers, so it'd probably take several years to rebuild simple computers by hand, then use those to build more and more complex computers from there. But it'd take far less than 70 years to ""catch up"" because we have the advantage of knowing the full history."
What is more environmentally friendly forced air hand dryers or paper towel?,"New air dryers (like the dyson air blade) are more environmentally friendly than paper towels. Older dryers might not be, because they use more power."
Why do some downloads not show file size and / or ETAs?,"When you make an HTTP connection, there are a bunch of pieces of metadata that are sent before the data. One of those is Content-Length, which tells your client how long the data portion is going to be. If you don't see a file size in a download, it means the server didn't send a Content-Length header, so your client has no idea how much data is going to come, and it just needs to continue receiving data until the server stops sending it."
How do coffee machines (like a Keurig) super heat water in 10 seconds?,"a thin layer of water heats up very quickly. Take a wet sponge, put it in the microwave for 10 seconds, it will be extremely hot. A cup of water wouldn't be warm in 10 seconds."
"When you boil water, where does the air that fills the bubbles come from?","""Boiling"" is the process of water becoming steam. The ""air"" in those bubbles is water turning into its gaseous form from its liquid form."
"... If yogurt is made with a starter of a small bit of yogurt, how was the first yogurt ever created?","They were not created, they were captured and bred from wild strains of bacteria. You could start the same sort of thing today, but your quality would be hit or miss (and the misses would be nasty)."
What causes something to have a smell?,"Molecules from it break off and float around in the air. Your nose picks them up, and your olfactory center ""reads"" them. Yes this means exactly what you think it means, when you smell poo."
"I'm British. How could Greece defaulting on its loan repayment and leaving the eurozone affect me, the rest of the EU and the global economy?","For one thing, some of that debt is owed to UK banks and institutions. They will have to take a loss, which could mean everything to high interest rates to outright bank failures. It will heard the economies of the EU in general, and those are some of the UK biggest trading partners. One the other hand, the weakened euro might make the pound more attractive, which could boost the UK economy."
S.A.D (Seasonal Affective Disorder),"Basically, not getting enough sun makes you depressed. That's why one of the ways to alleviate it is to use a light box."
The difference between deductive and inductive reasoning.,"> all cars are red. ""Hey I bought a car, Jack!"" ""Oh, then it must be red!"" ***Jack did a deduction.***  > ""This is swan number 1000, and **again** it is a white one."" ""Therefore it must be that all swans are white."" ***Jack did an induction.*** You might have noticed that though the deduction is always sound, and that its truth depends only on the truth of the premise, ***inductions are always faulty***: no matter how many swans you investigate, you'll never be certain there is not a black one waiting on you around the corner. Source: studied philosophy for years at uni in The Netherlands."
Why is it so difficult to fall asleep without a blanket even when you aren't cold?,"People develop patterns for going to sleep. When you lie down, put your head on a pillow and cover yourself with a blanket your body thinks ""ok, it's time to go to sleep"" because you've trained it to react that way. You could just as easily train your body with a different set of criteria for sleep."
"Why are some major media outlets speculating a Ted Cruz presidential run, ignoring that he was born in Canada?","His father was a Cuban who moved to the US in the 1950s (and was probably a US citizen by the time Cruz was born in 1970), his mother was born in US. You don't have to be born in the US to be eligible."
The way cops sometimes talk,"That is the sort of language they might use in a formal report or when testifying in court. It's filtered through to every day use with the public in part, I think, because the words are carefully selected not to have improper connotations, though it does sound rather awkward."
A few questions on house-buying stuff,"Equity in something means how much of a stake you have in its ownership. If you pay for the house in cash, then you own it, and you can borrow against it. If you take out a loan to buy it, then you only own it conditionally (so long as you keep making your payments to the bank). If you already have a mortgage on the house, then it will be harder to use it as collateral for a loan because you're already in debt on it."
At what point do under the table bank deposits become suspicious?,"The reporting limit is $10,000 but if you arrange multiple transactions that look like you should have done a single over $10,000 transaction you'll trip anti-money laundering law wires.  For taxes, you should report *all* income earned in a period, regardless of source."
"Why in ancient times anything but a pure wife was rejected, but some men married widows?","Men didn't prefer virgins because they got to be the first. It was about legacy. Everything they had and were would be passed on to a son, and they wanted to make sure that boy really was his son.  Marrying a virgin helped ensure this. Not only could the husband be sure she was not pregnant with another man's child, but she had followed the norm of society, and could be expected to continue to do so when married. Conversely, a woman known to have had sex out of marriage defied society, was considered a harlot who could not be trusted to remain faithful. In this scheme, a widow is almost as good as a virgin. She followed the rules and just had an unlucky break, so there was no reason to believe she would be any less faithful. Also, widows often inherited their husband's property and were more wealthy than a young woman still living with her family."
Why do people say county jail is worse than prison?,"County is nothing but laying and sitting, in a lot of places. Small town? You're just in a cell in a courthouse with a few other guys, beds, and a tv. Prison has other shit to do. Library, classes, exercise and what have you."
"why do large amounts of prize money, (e.g. $100,000 from a game show or a lottery prize) get taxed so much?","Lottery winnings are taxed as ordinary income at the Federal level, and by most states. The highest U.S. tax rate is 39.6%, and it's applied to any income over $418,401 for an individual. So on a big jackpot, that's almost 40% right off the top. Then of course your state gets to tax the income as well."
"That baby smell. Like on baby items in Toys R Us, what is it and why does it all smell the same?","It's made to smell like baby powder, which (fun fact) is rarely actually used on babies these days. But lots of diapers have that as their default scent, so babies still smell like it. The day my daughter was born, it blew my mind that she smelled just like the Cabbage Patch Kid I had when I was little. Then I realized it wasn't her, it was the hospital-issued Pampers she was wearing."
"How do owners of non-profit organizations or people who are ""experts"" in really odd things make money? Are most of them just retired or do they get paid by someone to do these things?","Non-profits are still business that have expenses. Sometimes it is an organization that pays salaries and overhead expenses. What is leftover from however they produce income is what is provided to their charity or organization.  As far as getting paid for odd jobs, that usually falls under the consultant category. Basically a company or individual seeks the advice of someone who specializes in a certain field or area. The most popular example would be something like website design where big companies can have an inhouse team, but small companies or non-profits, will contract someone to create their site... in which case the one time cost is significantly cheaper than a full time employee.  But there are people who specialize in some weird stuff and their specialty is sometimes needed. For example, while in college I met an archaeologist student who specialized in analyzing dung (basically human waste), well that speciality landed him a consulting role for a book that won a Pultizer.  Hope that helps"
What is on the papers that news anchors are continuously shuffling?,"Newsreaders usually have a small screen under the camera. On that screen, the text they read out is shown. This screen is called a ""teleprompter"". But in case the prompter breaks, they have the same text with them on paper, so they can continue reading the news."
How is headbutting someone effective? How do you hurt your opponent without hurting yourself?,You take the harder part of your head and aim for a softer part of theirs.
Most fracking happens at over 1 to 2 miles under ground. What is the theory that explains how that water gets through 2 miles of bedrock to pollute my 150 foot well?,"There is definitely the potential for fracking to pollute groundwater. The truth is, we don't really know for sure exactly how much the underground geology is altered when they use fracking. They inject an extraordinary amount of fluid into the ground under an extraordinary amount of pressure, fracturing the rock formations around the drilling site, which allows for easier extraction of natural gas and/or oil.. It's possible that these rock formations may have been separating oil or gas deposits from groundwater, and after the shale is fractured, these two may begin to mix, where they couldn't before."
"How do planes ""break"" the sound barrier?","The speed of sound is only about 780 miles per hour, and all you need to do to break the sound barrier is go faster than that. Most normal planes already go about 500~ mph, so boosting that up to 800~ isnt too hard"
"How can ""The Interview"" have an all persons fictitious disclaimer at the end, when it is clearly based on a real living person?","So the TL:NR is going to be ""That line doesn't really do jack"" here's why: Like someone using music or audio without consent saying ""Blahbity blah belongs to such and such, no claim to copyright is made"" or some such gives you no legal protection in court should that person decide to sue you the same is going to be true in satire. Being a public figure, Kim Jung Un, in the U.S., has little to no protection against satire, and even if he wanted to, he'd have to sue Sony, et al in U.S. courts for damages, and that's not going to happen. The litmus test, afaik, is simply ""Would a reasonable person believe this to be actual events?"""
Why did Longswords give way to rapiers and sabres during the Renaissance?,"I like most of the answers below, especially m4nu, but there's one big thing no one's mentioning: Armor. As technology progressed, muskets made armor utterly useless. Then, when hand to hand combat did occur, there was no need for a sword so heavy it would break a man's ribs through iron, just something to stab him with would do just fine. I always thought it was interesting that through Korea people quit using personal body armor and now it's coming back. Modern soldiers look about as covered up as a knight these days."
Is a human virgin birth scientifically possible?,"If a woman is a virgin until a penis enters her vagina, then yes, virgin births are possible. If a man were to ejaculate on her, it's possible that sperm cells could swim up the vaginal canal and make her pregnant."
How does Piratebay still manage to be a live website?,"This bully, Pirate von Bayinstein, goes to a school connected to yours. Every day at the joint lunchtime your two schools have together he steals the cookies your mom packed for you. This pisses you off, so you go to your teacher and tell on him. Unfortunately, while he may be breaking your school's rules, he is not breaking his own school's rules, and your teacher does not have the authority to punish him.  Your teacher is the US government, pirate von bayinstein is the pirate bay, and you are the MPAA/RIAA ect. TPB's servers are not in the US and are therefore not subject to our laws. The country where they are does not have any laws prohibiting what they do."
Why does Anime have a bad stigma?,"Hardcore fans argue otherwise, but the majority of anime *is* poorly-animated entertainment fodder marketed towards teenage boys. This is coming from someone who enjoys some anime series, but it's a medium that most Japanese natives look down on for this reason, too. Because anime is deemed a niche genre unto itself, even in its country of origin, *everything* (including shows that feature paedophilia, rape and so on) is tarred with the same brush. There's also the weeaboo phenomenon: Westerners who get into anime are mind-blown at this myopic exposure to one of the world's most unique cultures, and rather than research the parts they would inevitably find disagreeable, they latch onto fictionalised Japan as some kind of utopia willing to let pudgy white kids commandeer their culture."
"Theoretically, shouldn't a pyramid scheme work?",Pyramid schemes are 100% effective so long as the number of people joining exceeds the number of people who are already involved. This works because you can use the joiners money to pay off the oldest members. The problem is that the number of fools (while massive) is a finite number. Eventually the scheme cannot maintain cash flow.
How does radiation make you sick/kill you?,"Think of the radiation like tiny, tiny bullets. When you get radiation poisoning your bodies cells are getting hit by Billion of tiny bullets that go through your body. These bullets can damage things at the cellular level like DNA, causing it to break apart in the cell and killing the cell. These bullets can also break up alot of the molecules like hemoglobin, or hormones that your body needs. Not only does your body take damage but your body has to clean up the corpses of dead cells and the crazy new molecules that radiation has made."
Why is a baby not nine months old when its born?,"Because it's called a ""birth""day - we define your age as being measured by your date of birth. We do that because it's easier to know for sure the day that the baby came out of the mom than the day that the sperm hit the egg. Even with all our technology, there's no real 100% way to know ""Oh yeah, this was fertilized on May 8th."" So we base our date on what we know, and everything works out about the same."
what in our brain makes the auto alarm clock go off?,"I don't have this :(  If it weren't for my phone alarm, I'd probably be nowhere in life."
"What is actually going on with the oil companies, and why do the prices keep dropping?","all of these answers contain somewhat true points, but something to point out -- no one 'sets' oil prices, not the oil exploration and production companies, not OPEC, not anyone except the market. The two types of oil quoted when people talk about 'oil prices' are WTI (U.S. benchmark) and Brent Crude (North Sea, worldwide benchmark)...and these prices are set by futures contracts that are traded instruments. In other words, the price of oil is determined in much the same way the price of a stock is determined, not like the price of a good/service is determined. OPEC decided not to cut production (Saudi Arabia especially), which had the effect of driving prices down (supply/demand imbalance), but they do not actually decide what price they will be able to sell a barrel of oil."
"Why do most promotions say ""Purchase Not Necessary""?","If a purchase is necessary to enter the game of chance the promotion is classified as a lottery. Some governments, such as the US and the UK, deem as illegal. You should be able to get a piece for free by going to your local McDonalds and stating you'd like to enroll without a purchase. Your request must then legally be obliged, possibly with a postage paid form that you fill out and mail in and they will, in turn, will mail you a piece. I am not certain how frequently you can do this, but I believe it's once per day per household."
Why do people call Fifty Shades of Gray porn?,"It's an erotic novel, which is about as close to porn as you can get while still being a novel. From what I understand, it goes into great detail about the intimacy involved."
Why is it that Reddit only displays some of my subreddits in the drop down at one time?,The maximum number of subreddits for the drop down list is 50.
How and why did cannabis come to be illegal?,"because of systemic political racism.  back in the 1930's, mexicans and blacks smoke weed.  white people didn't.  so weed was make illegal to have a reason to put mexicans and blacks in jail."
Why is female handwriting generally distinguishable from male handwriting?,"Young girls fine motor skills tend to develop a few years earlier than young boys. This also coincides with schools teaching handwriting, ages 5-8. As a result girls can get a bit of a jumpstart on developing and perfecting their handwriting.  If you want to throw socializations in also, it is usually stressed that girls should be neat and precise, while boys tend to be given a bit more leeway in messiness....""boys will be boys"" excuse."
Why does sperm and bleach smell basically the same?,"If I remember my awkward Catholic school sex ed, the female reproductive canal is (very slightly) acidic. Therefore, the male ejaculate has to be slightly basic (alkaline) to counteract it. Bleach is a strong alkaline, hence a somewhat similar smell. Also, I think semen may contain an element of chlorine, we didn't get that far in class ;)"
How does the 'Stingray' work? Wouldn't you be able to hear interference on calls etc?,Your phone treats the Stingray as a local cell tower. And the Stingray passes through all cell phone traffic. It happens quick enough that any delay is not noticed. No interference is generated.  If you are concerned about Stingrays in your neighborhood see:  _URL_0_
What stops a journalist from printing anything 'off the record'?,"If you print something that was said to you in the course of performing your journalistic duties, you are basically betraying the trust of your source and burning that source. You do it once, you'd need some luck to be able to talk to anyone on the inside ever again."
what is the point of making medical students study all the subjects/all residential rotations?,"Humans are one giant interconnected network of neural, chemical, and structural oddities. To understand the brain, you have to understand the body, and vice versa. It isn't a waste of time *at all*, and is quite necessary to have a holistic understanding of any one branch of medicine or psychology."
Why were ancient cities buried or abandoned if they continued to grow into modern cities?,"Some cities have been around for thousands of years, and still are inhabited today. Rome or example or Istanbul.  Many cities were abandoned because of things like: 1. Natural Disasters 2. Lack of/exhaustion of local resources 3. Economic/Trade shifts"
Why do we perceive our vision as a single frame when we have two eyes?,"We have binocular vision, by using two eyes our brain receives to separate images with everything shifted slightly left or right. Your brain then takes the images and process them together into a single image, using the differences to give you depth perception and three dimensional vision. For example I am sitting at my computer screen. If I close one eye, then quickly open and close the other my computer screen seems to shift, this is because it's close to me. If I look out the window at a tree down the street and do the same that jump is minimal or imperceptible. This tells me the tree is far away.  Your brain is doing this in real time with the two images to constantly keep up our sense of depth."
Why does semen turn hard when exposed to hot water?,"The same reason eggs get more solid when they cook, I believe. The heat causes some of the proteins to denature. Proteins are kind of like balled-up organic strings. Since they are round, they easily bump past each other in a liquid. When they denature, they partially or completely unravel, and the loose ends get all tangled up with each other, creating a more solid structure."
LI5: Why wont the US government legalize marijuana?,"Legalizing marijuana is not a politically wise proposal to make. There are lots of reasons why this is so, but the core thing is that a politician would lose more votes from the minority that opposes marijuana than from the majority that supports it. As long as that is true, marijuana will not be legalized, no matter how strong the reasons are."
Why did Tipper Gore get so much hate from the music industry and fans during 1985 for wanting parental guidelines on music?,People thought they wanted to ban/censor music because that's exactly what they wanted to do. And they did it successfully at the time with Body Count's song Cop Killer. They put so much pressure on the label that the album was pulled from the shelf and the song was eventually replaced with a song called Freedom of Speach.     It wasn't just an emotional response to a perceived threat. It was a very literal threat against the freedom of expression.
How is math like a language?,In one sense math can be construed as the language of nature because it can explain natural phenomena as well as other things such as human behavior and the probability of future events.
How do trees survive winter?,"They can store nutrients below ground mostly. Think of syrup, which all decidious trees in northern climates produce. The flow of syrup is the tree moving sugars from its lower storage organs to its leaf buds yo support the new growth. Also woody tissue with secondary cell walls are dead so they aren't really supporting as much living tissue as it seems."
"Why in construction, when they lay rebar, is it in a grid pattern?",Because grids are easy and the structural integrity gained from triangles would not outway the massive extra time investment.
Why do Wind turbines have three blades?,"As a wind farm developer, let me direct you to the proper resource: _URL_3_ Essentially:  > ""Wind turbines extract energy by slowing down the wind. For a wind turbine to be 100% efficient it would need to stop 100% of the wind - but then the rotor would have to be a solid disk and it would not turn and no kinetic energy would be converted. On the other extreme, if you had a wind turbine with just one rotor blade, most of the wind passing through the area swept by the turbine blade would miss the blade completely and so the kinetic energy would be kept by the wind.  > Betz Limit Albert Betz was a German physicist who calculated that no wind turbine could convert more than 59.3% of the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical energy turning a rotor. This is known as the Betz Limit, and is the theoretical maximum coefficient of power for any wind turbine.  > the fact is that small scale (1-100 kW) always have lower efficiencies than large scale wind turbines. """
Why does diarrhea make your anus burn.,"Not to do with stomach acid, that should be neutralised before it gets anywhere near leaving your body (or it'd wreak havoc on your intestines on its way through). Probably because diarrhoea is wet and this, in addition to wiping more often than usual, irritates the skin around your butthole. Also, think about how babies get nappy rash from having wet nappies against their butts for extended periods, if you have wet soppy faeces (like swamp ass) because you couldn't clean it all properly it's going to start itching and irritating you."
What is the purpose of hanging highly irradiated patient's limbs up in the air?,Not a scientifically backed explanation as such but it might be to do with minimizing contact with surfaces to reduce the pain the subject is in. Any sort of second degree burn or worse hurts when it has pressure applied.
How is the melody encoded on a vinyl and how is it reproduced by a record player ?,"Such is the genius of Thomas Edison. It turns out sound waves are really pressure waves that exert force on your eardrums 'creating' sound. Vinyl is a soft material which is sensitive to subtle changes in force. Therefore to make a recording, an etching needle is placed on the vinyl and when sounds are made it moves the needle up and down according to the pressure exerted by the sound wave. As a result it literally converts a pressure wave into a physical shape. To play back, the opposite occurs. You run a needle over the record and the needle moves a diaphragm back and forth converting the 'shape' of the sound wave back into an actual sound."
Why can we multiply by 0 but not divide by 0.,"Let's put it this way - you can't divide something into zero parts. You can divide it into one part, but not zero parts. That's an illogical question (what happens if you divide $10 in zero parts?) There's no answer. Here: $0 x 12 months = I'll give you $0 every month for 12 months. How much money will you have after a year? $0. $12 x 0 months = I'll give you $12 every month, but no months have occurred yet. How much money do you have? $0. $0/12 months = You've made $0 in a year - how much did you make monthly? $0 $12/0 months = You've made $12 in the span of no time at all. How much money did you make monthly? Um...well...I didn't make money monthly. There's no way to calculate this, because there's no time on the scale."
How did child rearing work before diapers?,"As far as infants, cloth and linen were often used as diapers, this is shown in native tribes. Disposable diapers are relatively new. Many people still use cloth diapers as they tend to be better for an infants skin. Thorough cleaning was just very important."
"When naming a new royal, are there only certain names they are allowed to use or is it just assumed they'll use a previous royal name?","It comes down to custom and tradition. For instance, with British royalty, they need to pick a British name. Custom dictates they can't go with something like Barbara or Fleur. Custom shows that typically they choose names to honor other family members or royalty. That's how they chose Charlotte, Elizabeth, and Diana as the three names for the Princess. You want something with historical significance and personal significance."
"According to the BBC: pilots used the aircrafts' sensors to confirm ""no civilians were in the proximity of the targets"" In the Syrian Bombings. How?","It basically means ""We hit the designated target. The target was defined as hostile, therefore everybody there were enemies. If there were any civilians, we define them as enemies as well."". In other words, they only know that the bombs hit as intended, they don't know who was there or if the intelligence that selected the target was correct."
Why do dogs throw up when they're hungry?,I guess you have never been really hungry. Not an insult I just mean humans do the same thing its just we can just feed our selves or drink water or something to stop the hunger before it gets to that point. As a former homeless dude I have been that hungry you start to drool and it burns in your belly till you just got to let it out. hurts. it sucks.
